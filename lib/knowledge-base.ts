For men over 40, 50, 60, and beyond, recovery is not optional — it is a mandatory part of the transformation process. The goal is not just to complete one workout. The goal is to train consistently for life without injury. Training creates the stimulus. Nutrition provides the fuel. Recovery allows the body to adapt, repair, grow, and keep going. A man who skips recovery may still train hard, but he will eventually break down. A man who respects recovery can train consistently for years. Consistency beats intensity. Longevity beats ego. Recovery keeps men in the game.",

A well-designed session has five phases: warm-up, priming, main workout, cool-down, and mobility. Rushing or skipping any phase leaves results on the table and increases injury risk. The session structure communicates respect for the man's body and his time. One of the biggest mistakes trainers and trainees make is failing to plan the entire session. Warm-ups are rushed. Stretching is forgotten. The session ends abruptly. That leaves your body without the full benefits of a complete training experience. For men over 40, the cool-down and mobility phase is just as important as the main workout.",

Men who make dramatic health transformations after 40 share one trait: they made a decision that their health was non-negotiable. Not a wish. Not a goal. A decision. From that decision, every action becomes aligned. Mindset is not soft — it is the foundation that everything else is built on. Without it, even the best program will eventually be abandoned.",

For men over 40, mobility work is not optional — it is what allows everything else to continue. Tight hips cause back pain. Poor shoulder mobility causes rotator cuff problems.

Millions of men over 40 are struggling with fatigue, low libido, brain fog, stubborn belly fat, poor recovery, and loss of drive. They get blood work and are told everything is 'normal.' But normal reference ranges are not the standard of a thriving, vital man. The concept of sovereignty: when men regain their energy, clarity, and vitality, they begin asking deeper questions about purpose, passion, and fulfillment. This interview is about more than fixing hormones. It is about rebuilding the man.",

Open Monitoring meditation broadens awareness to observe all thoughts, sensations, and emotions without attachment, developing nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment. Five essential elements of effective meditation include: a quiet environment to minimize external distractions, a comfortable posture whether sitting, lying, or walking, a point of focus such as breath or mantra, an open and receptive attitude toward whatever arises, and consistent practice over time.

Studies show cortisol levels drop significantly after eight weeks of regular practice. Inflammation markers including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, which accelerate aging and suppress testosterone, show meaningful reductions in meditators.

Zinc (25-45mg daily) is the most critical mineral for testosterone production — zinc deficiency is directly correlated with low testosterone and is extremely common in men who sweat regularly. Vitamin D3 (5000 IU daily with K2) acts as a steroid hormone precursor — virtually every cell in the body has vitamin D receptors, and men with optimal vitamin D levels have significantly higher testosterone. Boron (3-10mg daily) increases free testosterone by reducing SHBG, which binds and inactivates testosterone. Ashwagandha (KSM-66, 300-600mg daily) reduces cortisol by 27-30% in clinical trials, directly supporting testosterone. Tongkat Ali (200-400mg daily) supports LH and testosterone production. DIM (Diindolylmethane, 200-400mg daily) balances estrogen metabolism to favor less potent estrogen metabolites, reducing the testosterone-suppressing effects of estrogen dominance.",

HMB (Beta-Hydroxy Beta-Methylbutyrate, 3g daily) reduces muscle protein breakdown and is particularly effective for men over 40 due to its anti-catabolic properties. Whey protein isolate (25-35g) post-workout provides rapidly absorbed leucine-rich protein that maximally stimulates muscle protein synthesis. Leucine specifically (2-3g per meal) is the amino acid that triggers the muscle-building mTOR pathway — older men need more leucine per meal than younger men to achieve the same anabolic response.

Magnesium glycinate (400mg taken 45-60 min before bed) is the foundational sleep supplement — it activates GABA receptors, relaxes muscle tissue, reduces cortisol, and has the best absorption profile of all magnesium forms. Phosphatidylserine (400mg daily) is a phospholipid that blunts cortisol response to exercise and stress, directly supporting testosterone by reducing the cortisol-testosterone antagonism. L-theanine (200mg before bed) promotes alpha brainwave activity associated with relaxed alertness without sedation, improving sleep quality without grogginess. Magnesium threonate specifically crosses the blood-brain barrier and may improve sleep architecture and cognitive function. Combining magnesium glycinate with L-theanine creates a powerful non-sedating sleep quality stack without dependency risk.",

Curcumin with piperine (1000-1500mg daily, always with black pepper extract or fat for absorption) is the active compound in turmeric with powerful NF-kB pathway inhibition — blocking the molecular inflammation switch. Boswellia serrata (400-800mg daily) specifically reduces joint inflammation via a different pathway than curcumin, making them highly synergistic.

Bergamot extract (500mg daily) has clinical evidence for improving lipid profiles including reducing LDL, raising HDL, and reducing triglycerides without the side effects of statins. Aged garlic extract (600mg daily) reduces arterial stiffness, lowers blood pressure, and has antiplatelet effects.

Cortisol rises driving belly fat storage. Energy crashes create sugar cravings. Fat-burning hormones including testosterone and growth hormone decline. Caffeine combined with yohimbe stimulates catecholamines including adrenaline and noradrenaline that unlock fat cells. Yohimbe specifically blocks alpha-2 receptors that trap fat in stubborn areas like belly and love handles. Use cautiously in the morning or pre-workout in a fasted state, avoiding with high blood pressure or anxiety. Green Tea Extract EGCG enhances thermogenesis and fat oxidation by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down norepinephrine, prolonging fat-burning signals. Blood sugar support ingredients including chromium, cinnamon bark, and banaba leaf improve insulin sensitivity, stabilize blood glucose, and prevent fat storage. The Metabolic, Cardiovascular, and Anti-Inflammatory Stack addresses chronic inflammation as the root cause of most chronic disease in men over 40. Elevated blood sugar sticks to low-density lipoproteins increasing arterial damage and cholesterol synthesis. The NF-kB pathway is the molecular inflammation switch. Blocking chronic NF-kB activation with curcumin and other anti-inflammatories is critical. Blood Sugar Ultra ROC803 combines cinnamon bark, banaba leaf, and chromium picolinate for blood glucose control. Premium Adaptogen Blend ROC726 combines ashwagandha, rhodiola rosea, and turmeric for cortisol balance and inflammation control.

Life is pretty simple. The hard part is showing up in the gym three days a week for 60 years. His career-changing discovery: loaded carries. After breaking his wrist in eight pieces and being told he would never train again, Dan focused on farmer walks and suitcase carries during rehabilitation. They transformed his training. For men over 40, loaded carries are among the best exercises available: they build real-world strength, challenge the core, and are joint-friendly.",

Most men are conditioned to look for symptoms and assume health is the absence of those symptoms.

Men over 40 feel older than they are because they have accumulated decades of physical and emotional stress, lost mobility through sedentary careers, and allowed muscle mass to decline. The nervous system becomes dysregulated under this accumulated load. Chiropractic alignment, movement restoration, and stress regulation are tools to restore the complete system.",

Modern healthcare has produced tremendous benefits, but it has also produced a culture of assumption — where men accept diagnoses and protocols without asking how the underlying claims were established. For men over 40, the practical application is: do your own research, question conventional test interpretations, explore holistic and functional medicine approaches alongside conventional care, and do not accept a normal lab result as equivalent to optimal health.",

Mollie works with high performers and men over 40 to treat sleep as a performance skill: understanding sleep architecture, circadian biology, light exposure, temperature, and nervous system regulation.

The answer is fixing the system that creates energy in the first place. Mitochondria are the cellular powerhouses that produce all metabolic energy. As they decline in density and efficiency through lifestyle damage, the body struggles to produce energy, burns glucose inefficiently, stores fat more readily, and loses the ability to adapt to metabolic demands. The fix: food quality over quantity, fat adaptation to restore metabolic flexibility, meal timing with fasting windows, circadian rhythm alignment through light exposure management, and daily movement especially walking.",

After training and working as a general surgeon, Marco shifted from treating disease to preventing it — helping men take control of their health before problems start. He combines a medical background with an athletic mindset (former Division I athlete) and works at the intersection of medicine and performance, using advanced diagnostics, hormone optimization, and lifestyle strategies.

NUTRITION AS FOUNDATIONAL STRATEGY: The single most important nutritional principle is having a strategy that supports your goal. 'Flavor of the month' diets are tactical, not strategic — they work for 6-week programs but not for the 6 decades you want to pay dividends. Most men confuse tactics with strategy.

CORNERSTONE FRAMEWORK: Like a head cornerstone in architecture, nutrition is the base upon which everything else is built. Most physicians are never exposed to nutrition in medical school — this is a system failure. When you combine medical diagnostics with nutrition strategy and strength coaching, the results are transformative.

WHAT WORKS FOR MEN OVER 40: (1) Prioritize protein — muscle mass preservation becomes critical after 40 as muscle loss accelerates. (2) Understand your metabolic baseline through diagnostics (bloodwork, hormones, inflammation markers). (3) Reduce ultra-processed foods and seed oils, which drive chronic inflammation. (4) Time your nutrition around your training. (5) Get your hormones checked — low testosterone, insulin resistance, and thyroid dysfunction all show up as 'I'm just getting older' symptoms that are treatable.

PREVENTIVE vs REACTIVE MEDICINE: The conventional healthcare system waits for disease. Age management medicine intervenes earlier — identifying risk markers 10-15 years before disease manifests. Men over 40 should get comprehensive bloodwork including testosterone (total + free), SHBG, estradiol, thyroid panel, inflammation markers (hsCRP, homocysteine), metabolic panel, and nutrient levels (Vitamin D, B12, magnesium).`,

    content: `Marcello is a niche fragrance collector, educator, and founder of the Niche Fragrance Collector YouTube channel and KEM Fragrance Tours. His masterclass at the Men Over 40 Health Summit covers the power of scent as a wellness and confidence tool — a dimension of self-care most men completely overlook.

WHY FRAGRANCE MATTERS FOR MEN OVER 40: 'Perfume is the mystery of you.' Scent creates instant impressions and signals presence, confidence, and attention to detail. A man who smells exceptional projects authority and sophistication. Activating all senses is part of living fully — most men deprioritize this completely.

FRAGRANCE TYPES (Oil Concentration Guide):
• Eau de Cologne (3-5% oil): Bright, effervescent, citrus-forward. Lasts 4-5 hours. Best for casual use.
• Eau de Toilette (10-15% oil): Office-appropriate, 5-6 hours, moderate complexity.
• Eau de Parfum (15-23% oil): Recommended for most men. Complex, 12+ hours, multiple evolving notes.
• Extrait de Parfum (23-30%+): Extremely dense and complex, longest lasting, most expensive.
• Attar/Oil Perfume: No alcohol, oil-based, dabbed on heat spots — lasts 24-48 hours.

THE FRAGRANCE WARDROBE CONCEPT: Just as you have different clothing for different occasions, you should have different fragrances — a daily office scent, a formal/event scent, a casual weekend scent, and a date/intimate scent. This is a sign of intentional living and elevated presence.

APPLICATION TECHNIQUE: Always spray on skin (not clothing) for heat activation. Target pulse points — neck, wrists, inner elbows, chest. The fragrance evolves as skin temperature rises. A proper fragrance opens with top notes, evolves through heart notes, and dries down to base notes over hours.

SENSORY WELLNESS INSIGHT: Smell is tied directly to the limbic system — the brain's emotional center. Scent triggers memory and emotion faster than any other sense. Wearing intentional fragrance is a daily ritual that grounds you in the present, elevates confidence, and signals to yourself and others that you take your presentation and experience of life seriously.`,
    quote: `If we couldn't smell, our lives would be black and white. When you activate your nose, all of a sudden your life becomes technicolor.`,

    content: `THE ALPHA SLEEP PHILOSOPHY — Over 40 Alpha Sleep Challenge (Funk Roberts)

CORE PHILOSOPHY PILLARS:
1. SLEEP IS YOUR #1 RECOVERY WEAPON: Sleep is the absolute foundation for fat loss, testosterone production, and overall health. You cannot out-train, out-eat, or out-supplement poor sleep. If your sleep is broken, your testosterone is broken.

2. DEEP SLEEP IS THE ANABOLIC HORMONE SUPERCHARGER: ~90% of daily testosterone is produced during deep and REM sleep (first 3-5 sleep cycles). This is when the body releases Growth Hormone, DHEA, and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) to rebuild muscle, burn belly fat, and restore drive.

3. SLEEP IS A RELATIONSHIP, NOT A TRANSACTION: Great sleep is the natural outcome of how you structure your day, your light exposure, and your nervous system regulation — not willpower.

4. RHYTHM IS RECOVERY: The body thrives on a predictable 24-hour circadian rhythm. Consistency is far more important than perfection. When your body knows exactly when to power up and wind down, you build natural sleep pressure that produces deep rest.

5. AIM FOR RESTORATIVE SLEEP: Men over 40 should achieve 3-4 hours of restorative sleep (Deep + REM) within 7-9 hours total. Quality over quantity.

THE 9 FUNK ROBERTS ALPHA SLEEP RULES:
Rule 1 — Anchor Your Wake Time & Morning Light: Pick a wake time and keep it within 30-minute variation. Get 5-10 minutes of natural sunlight within 30-60 minutes of waking to anchor circadian rhythm.

Rule 2 — Stimulus Control: The bed is for sleep and sex ONLY. Never scroll, email, or watch TV in bed.

Rule 3 — The 20-Minute Rule: If awake and frustrated for 20 minutes, get up. Go to a low-light calm zone (read fiction or deep breathe) and only return when sleepy.

Rule 4 — Master the Alpha Wind-Down Routine: Sleep starts 30-60 minutes before your head hits the pillow. Shut down all screens and blue light 60 minutes before bed. Switch to dim lamps or red lights.

Rule 5 — Optimize Thermal & Light Environment: Keep bedroom at 60-67°F (16-19°C). Make the room pitch black. Eliminate all electronics and LED lights.

Rule 6 — Time Your Nutrition & Caffeine: Cut off ALL caffeine by 1-2 PM. Finish last large meal 2-3 hours before bed. If needed, small protein + healthy fat snack (Greek yogurt, walnuts) to stabilize blood sugar.

Rule 7 — Use the 4-2-6-2 Breathing Protocol: Activate parasympathetic system before bed. For 5-10 minutes: Inhale 4 sec → Hold 2 sec → Exhale 6 sec → Hold 2 sec. Lowers cortisol, boosts melatonin.

Rule 8 — Stop Trying to Sleep (Paradoxical Intention): Remove sleep performance anxiety. Instead, gently aim to stay awake in a relaxed state. Tell yourself: 'I give myself permission to rest.'

Rule 9 — Bad Night Bounce-Back Protocol: Do NOT sleep in, do NOT over-caffeinate, do NOT take long naps. Wake at normal time, get morning sunlight, limit naps to 15-20 min before 2 PM, resume normal rhythm.`,
    quote: `Sleep is your #1 recovery weapon. You cannot out-train, out-eat, or out-supplement poor sleep. If your sleep is broken, your testosterone is broken.`,

    content: `THE 7-MINUTE SLEEP RESET PROTOCOL — For Men Over 40 Who Wake Up at Night

WHY MEN WAKE UP AND CAN'T FALL BACK ASLEEP:
• Cortisol Spike — stress hormone wakes you and keeps mind racing
• Blood Sugar Drop — low blood sugar triggers adrenaline release
• Poor Sleep Environment — light, temperature, or discomfort disrupts deep sleep
• Overthinking & Anxiety — brain stays in problem-solving mode

THE 7-MINUTE SLEEP RESET PROTOCOL:

Step 1 (0-10 sec) — STOP Looking at the Clock: Looking at the clock triggers stress. Accept you woke up and move into reset mode. Mindset: 'It's okay — I'm going to use this time to get even deeper sleep.'

Step 2 (1 min) — 4-7-8 Breathing Method: Inhale 4 sec, Hold 7 sec, Exhale 8 sec. Shifts nervous system into relaxation mode. Activates parasympathetic system (rest & digest).

Step 3 (1 min) — Full-Body Relaxation Scan: Mentally scan head to toe releasing tension. Focus on relaxing jaw, shoulders, and lower back first. Breathe slowly.

Step 4 (2 min) — Legs-Up Pose: Lay on back, legs up against wall. Hold 2 min with slow breathing. Reduces blood flow to brain — lowers anxiety and cortisol. Forces nervous system shift from fight-or-flight.

Step 5 (2 min) — Reverse Sleep Countdown: Count backward from 100 slowly. Imagine sinking into bed with each number. If mind drifts, gently return to counting. Distracts brain from overthinking, slows brain wave activity.

BONUS — Sleep Reset Drink (if woke from hunger/blood sugar drop):
Mix: Warm water + tart cherry juice (1 oz) + magnesium powder (200-400mg) + pinch of sea salt. Tart cherry naturally boosts melatonin; magnesium relaxes muscles and nervous system; salt stabilizes blood sugar.`,

    content: `HOW TO FIX SLEEP AFTER A BAD NIGHT & STILL BURN FAT — 6-Step Protocol

WHAT A BAD NIGHT OF SLEEP DOES:
Spikes cortisol (stress hormone), slows metabolism, increases sugar/carb cravings, lowers testosterone and recovery, disrupts fat-burning rhythm. One bad night won't ruin progress — unless you let it spiral.

THE 6 STEPS:

Step 1 — WAKE UP ON SCHEDULE (No Sleeping In): Stick to your usual wake-up time even after 4-5 hours. Sleeping in delays circadian rhythm, throws off melatonin, makes next night worse. Immediately open curtains or go outside — sunlight in eyes resets sleep-wake cycle.

Step 2 — MOVE FIRST THING: 5-10 min of walking, mobility, or light stretching. Add deep nasal breathing to lower cortisol. Bonus: go barefoot outside (grounding). Shakes off sleep inertia and improves fat metabolism even when tired.

Step 3 — HYDRATE & STABILIZE BLOOD SUGAR: After poor sleep, body becomes more insulin resistant and craves carbs. Drink 16-24 oz water with electrolytes or pink salt. Eat protein + healthy fat breakfast (eggs + avocado, protein shake + almond butter). Avoid sugary coffee, toast, cereal, or high-carb meals.

Step 4 — PRIORITIZE FAT-BURNING, NOT EXHAUSTING WORKOUTS: Avoid high-intensity HIIT or heavy lifting (further spikes cortisol). Instead do fat-burning metabolic circuit, recovery band session, or walk.

Step 5 — STRATEGIC NAPPING (Optional): 10-20 min power nap before 2 PM ONLY. Any later disrupts nighttime sleep. Do NOT nap if you have insomnia — it reduces sleep pressure needed to sleep at night.

Step 6 — PREPARE BETTER SLEEP TONIGHT: Cut caffeine after 12 PM. Extra magnesium (400-500mg glycinate). Begin wind-down 90 min earlier. Room to 65°F. Do 10 min 4-7-8 breathing before sleep.`,
    protocol: [
      `Wake at normal time regardless of hours slept — no sleeping in`,
      `Get sunlight immediately upon waking to reset circadian rhythm`,
      `5-10 min gentle movement first thing: walk, mobility, or stretch`,
      `Drink 16-24 oz water + electrolytes; eat protein + fat breakfast`,
      `Avoid HIIT and heavy lifting after bad sleep — fat-burn walk or mobility instead`,
      `Power nap: 10-20 min ONLY before 2 PM if needed`,
      `Tonight: cut caffeine after noon, take extra magnesium, begin wind-down 90 min earlier`,

    content: `RESTORATIVE SLEEP: WHY QUALITY BEATS QUANTITY FOR MEN OVER 40
(Funk Roberts — Over 40 Alpha Podcast Episode 192)

THE CORE TRUTH: You can sleep 8 hours and wake up exhausted. Hours alone don't matter — the type of sleep does. For men over 40, the goal is achieving 3-4 hours of RESTORATIVE sleep (Deep Sleep + REM) within a 7-9 hour window.

WHAT RESTORATIVE SLEEP DOES:
• Repairs muscle tissue and releases Growth Hormone
• Regulates and produces testosterone
• Burns fat during deep sleep stages
• Strengthens immune system
• Processes memories and regulates emotions
• Cleans waste products (including amyloid plaques) from the brain

THE TWO CRITICAL STAGES:

DEEP SLEEP (Slow Wave Sleep): The physically restorative stage. This is when Growth Hormone is released, muscle is rebuilt, immune function is restored, and blood pressure drops. Men over 40 naturally get less deep sleep — and this is why they feel older.

REM SLEEP (Rapid Eye Movement): The mentally restorative stage. Processes emotions, consolidates memory, regulates mood and testosterone. Most men are chronically REM-deficient without knowing it.

HOW SLEEP DEPRIVATION DESTROYS MEN OVER 40:
• Just 1 week of sleep deprivation = testosterone levels of a man 10-15 years older
• Poor sleep raises cortisol → cortisol kills testosterone and causes belly fat storage
• Disrupts ghrelin (hunger up) and leptin (fullness down) — impossible to lose weight
• Impairs glucose control → more fat storage, especially visceral abdominal fat

HOW TO MAXIMIZE RESTORATIVE SLEEP:
1. Protect your first 90-minute sleep cycle (deepest sleep) — go to bed at the same time nightly
2. Avoid alcohol within 3 hours of bed — it kills REM sleep even if it makes you drowsy
3. Keep bedroom cold (60-67°F) — core temp drop triggers deep sleep
4. Magnesium glycinate (400mg) before bed enhances deep sleep quality
5. Don't exercise intensely within 2-3 hours of bed — raises core temp
6. Track your sleep quality, not just duration — use HRV or sleep score apps`,
    quote: `Not all sleep is created equal. For men over 40, quality matters even more than quantity — specifically, the restorative deep sleep and REM stages where testosterone, growth hormone, and recovery happen.`,
    protocol: [
      `Target 3-4 hours of restorative (Deep + REM) sleep within 7-9 hours total`,
      `Consistent bedtime protects the critical first 90-min deep sleep cycle`,
      `No alcohol within 3 hours of bed — it destroys REM sleep`,
      `Bedroom at 60-67°F — core temp drop is the trigger for deep sleep`,

    content: `21-DAY ALPHA BREATHWORK CHALLENGE — Complete Program Guide
By Funk Roberts & Over 40 Alpha

PROGRAM PURPOSE: A 21-day step-by-step breathwork program for men over 40, 50, 60, and 70. Reduce anxiety, stress, and cortisol; improve relaxation, focus, and concentration; potentially increase testosterone levels. Master 7 powerful breathwork techniques and build a daily practice.

WHY BREATHWORK IS ESSENTIAL AFTER 40:
• Reduces Anxiety & Stress: Activates parasympathetic nervous system — calms the mind
• Improves Relaxation: Allows recovery from the pressures of daily life
• Decreases Cortisol: High cortisol from chronic stress is the testosterone killer — breathwork lowers it
• Boosts Energy: Improved oxygenation = more mitochondrial energy production
• Enhances Focus: Better oxygen delivery to the brain = sharper mental clarity
• Supports Hormones: Lower cortisol = higher testosterone — the connection is direct

THE 7 BREATHING TECHNIQUES IN THE 21-DAY CHALLENGE:

1. DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING (Days 1-3): Deep belly breathing that activates the vagus nerve. Inhale fully into the belly (not chest), hold briefly, exhale slowly. 5-10 min daily.

2. BOX BREATHING (Days 4-6): Inhale 4 sec, Hold 4 sec, Exhale 4 sec, Hold 4 sec. Used by Navy SEALs for stress management and focus under pressure.

3. 4-7-8 BREATHING (Days 7-9): Inhale 4 sec, Hold 7 sec, Exhale 8 sec. Powerful for sleep onset and anxiety reduction.

4. TACTICAL BREATHING (Days 10-12): Combat breathing to lower heart rate rapidly. Inhale 4 sec, Hold 4 sec, Exhale 4 sec. Used before high-performance situations.

5. WIM HOF POWER BREATHING (Days 13-15): 30-40 rapid deep breaths, then exhale and hold. Increases oxygen, alkalizes blood, reduces inflammation, boosts energy.

6. COHERENCE BREATHING (Days 16-18): 5 seconds in, 5 seconds out. Creates heart-rate variability coherence between heart and brain — the ideal recovery state.

7. INTEGRATED DAILY PRACTICE (Days 19-21): Combine techniques — morning power breathing, afternoon box breathing, evening 4-7-8 for sleep.`,
    quote: `Breathwork may be one of the most underutilized tools for men over 40. It directly reduces cortisol, improves testosterone, and gives you a recovery tool that requires no equipment and zero cost.`,
    protocol: [
      `Day 1-3: Diaphragmatic breathing — 5-10 min of deep belly breathing daily`,
      `Day 4-6: Box breathing — 4 sec in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold for stress/focus`,
      `Day 7-9: 4-7-8 breathing — 4 in, 7 hold, 8 out — best for sleep and anxiety`,
      `Day 10-12: Tactical breathing — inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4 — before pressure situations`,
      `Day 13-15: Wim Hof — 30-40 rapid deep breaths then hold exhale`,
      `Day 16-18: Coherence breathing — 5 sec in, 5 sec out — for HRV and recovery`,
      `Day 19-21: Integrate all — morning power, afternoon box, evening 4-7-8`,
      `Minimum daily: 5 minutes of breathwork — the ROI is enormous`,

    content: `WIM HOF POWER BREATHING FOR MEN OVER 40

BACKGROUND: The Wim Hof Method, developed by Dutch extreme athlete Wim Hof, uses cycles of deep inhalations followed by passive exhalations, ending with breath holds. This is one of the most powerful performance and recovery tools available to men over 40.

PHYSICAL BENEFITS:
• Increased Oxygen: Deep breathing significantly increases O2 levels — enhances performance and endurance
• Enhanced Energy: Oxygen boost reduces fatigue
• Improved Circulation: Increased blood flow improves cardiovascular health
• Pain Reduction: Endorphin release reduces pain perception
• Reduced Inflammation: Alkalizes the blood, reducing chronic systemic inflammation

MENTAL BENEFITS:
• Reduced Stress and Anxiety: Activates PNS (parasympathetic nervous system)
• Improved Mental Clarity: Better oxygen delivery to the brain
• Increased Willpower and Discipline: Mastering cold exposure builds mental toughness
• Better Mood: Triggers endorphin and dopamine release

THE WIM HOF POWER BREATHING PROTOCOL:

ROUND 1-3 (repeat for 3-4 rounds):
1. Inhale FULLY through the nose/mouth — expand chest and belly completely
2. Exhale PASSIVELY — just release, no forced exhale
3. Repeat rapidly 30-40 times
4. After last exhale — HOLD the exhale (lungs empty) as long as comfortable
5. When you need to breathe — take one big recovery breath, hold 15 sec
6. Exhale, rest 30 sec — then begin next round

IMPORTANT SAFETY: Always practice seated or lying down. NEVER near water. You may feel tingling, light-headedness, or euphoria — this is normal.

COLD EXPOSURE COMBINATION: After Wim Hof breathing, the body is primed for cold exposure. End showers with 30-90 seconds cold. This combination maximally activates the sympathetic nervous system then parasympathetic recovery — the ultimate performance cycle.

    content: `THE STRESS REDUCTION PILLAR — Calm the Nervous System, Lower Cortisol, Reclaim Control

THE PROBLEM: Most men over 40 are living in constant 'fight or flight' mode. Work pressure, financial responsibilities, family obligations, poor sleep, social media keep the body in chronic stress. When stress remains elevated too long:
• Cortisol increases → Testosterone decreases
• Belly fat increases → Recovery suffers
• Sleep quality declines → Energy drops
• Motivation decreases → Anxiety and irritability rise

THE SOLUTION: Not to eliminate stress — but to manage and RECOVER from it.

THE STRESS REDUCTION PILLAR RULES:

Rule #1 — PRACTICE BREATHWORK DAILY: Breathwork is the fastest way to shift from stressed to relaxed.
Daily Minimum: 5 minutes. Protocol: 4-2-6-2 Breathing:
• Inhale through nose 4 sec → Hold 2 sec → Exhale through nose 6 sec → Hold 2 sec

Rule #2 — COLD THERAPY (1-3x per week): Cold showers or cold water immersion activate the vagus nerve, reduce inflammation, and teach the nervous system to tolerate stress. Start with 30-60 sec cold at end of shower.

Rule #3 — LIMIT SCREEN/NEWS EXPOSURE: Set phone-free periods. No news first 30 min of morning. No screens 60 min before bed. Constant digital input keeps the nervous system activated.

Rule #4 — JOURNALING (5-10 min daily): Brain dump thoughts before bed — offloads mental load from the prefrontal cortex. Write 3 things you're grateful for + 1 intention for tomorrow.

Rule #5 — NATURE & MOVEMENT: Walking in nature (even 10-15 min) lowers cortisol measurably. Combine with grounding (barefoot on grass/earth).

Rule #6 — CONNECTION & COMMUNITY: Isolation is a cortisol driver. Regular connection with purpose-aligned men, brotherhood, and meaningful relationships is physiologically protective.`,
    protocol: [
      `Daily: 5 min 4-2-6-2 breathing (4 in, 2 hold, 6 out, 2 hold)`,
      `1-3x/week: Cold shower 30-60 sec at end — activates vagus nerve`,
      `No phone/news for first 30 min of morning — protect your nervous system`,
      `No screens 60 min before bed`,
      `5-10 min journaling before bed: brain dump + 3 gratitudes + 1 tomorrow intention`,
      `10-15 min nature walk — measurably lowers cortisol`,

    content: `BEST VITAMINS FOR MEN OVER 40 — Complete Guide
(Funk Roberts — Over 40 Alpha Podcast Episode 188)

THE NON-NEGOTIABLE VITAMIN FOUNDATION FOR MEN OVER 40:

1. VITAMIN D3 + K2 (5,000-10,000 IU D3 with 100-200mcg K2):
Critical for testosterone production, bone density, immune function, mood, and cardiovascular health. Most men over 40 are severely deficient. D3 without K2 can cause calcium to deposit in arteries — always pair them. Test your levels annually (optimal: 60-80 ng/mL).

2. MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE (400-500mg before bed):
The mineral almost every man is deficient in. Required for 300+ enzymatic reactions. Directly involved in testosterone production. Magnesium glycinate is the most bioavailable form — better absorbed, doesn't cause digestive issues. Also improves sleep quality dramatically.

3. OMEGA-3 FISH OIL (2-4g EPA/DHA daily):
Reduces systemic inflammation (the root cause of most age-related decline), supports brain function, reduces triglycerides, improves joint health, and enhances heart health. Take with meals containing fat.

4. ZINC (25-40mg daily):
Essential for testosterone synthesis — zinc deficiency directly causes testosterone drop. Also critical for immune function, wound healing, and prostate health. Zinc picolinate or gluconate are best absorbed forms. Take with food to prevent nausea.

5. B-COMPLEX VITAMINS:
B12 (especially methylcobalamin), B6, and folate are critical for energy metabolism, nervous system, and red blood cell production. B12 absorption declines significantly with age. Many men are functionally deficient even with normal blood tests. Methylated forms (methylcobalamin, methylfolate) bypass MTHFR gene variants that prevent conversion.

6. VITAMIN C (500-1,000mg):
Reduces cortisol response post-exercise, supports immune function, collagen synthesis for joint health, and acts as an antioxidant protecting testosterone-producing Leydig cells.

7. ASHWAGANDHA (300-600mg KSM-66 extract):
The most evidence-backed adaptogen for men over 40. Reduces cortisol by 25-30%, directly supports testosterone production, improves sleep quality, and builds stress resilience.

8. CREATINE MONOHYDRATE (3-5g daily):
One of the most researched and proven supplements. Builds strength and muscle, supports brain health, improves power output, and helps counter age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia).`,
    quote: `Most men over 40 are walking around vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, and omega-3 deficient — and wondering why they feel like crap, have low testosterone, and can't sleep.`,
    protocol: [
      `Vitamin D3 (5,000-10,000 IU) + K2 (100-200mcg) — take with fat-containing meal`,

By Navin Khan — Sports Nutritionist, Exercise Physiologist, Head of R&D at Rocktomic Labs

THE CORE STRUGGLES SUPPLEMENTS ADDRESS AFTER 40:
• Energy crashes from declining testosterone, hydration issues, poor nutrient absorption
• Muscle loss (sarcopenia) — ~1% muscle loss per year after 40 if not actively countered
• Slower recovery — nagging injuries, longer soreness, reduced protein synthesis
• Hormonal shifts — testosterone drops, cortisol rises, insulin sensitivity worsens
• Digestive health — gut function and nutrient absorption decline
• Inflammation & joint pain — stiffness, aches, reduced mobility

THE 5 STACK CATEGORIES:

1. FOUNDATIONAL HEALTH STACK (The Base):
Multivitamin + Vitamin D3K2 + Magnesium → Replaces nutrient gaps that directly impact testosterone, energy, and immune function. Without these cofactors, testosterone production and recovery slow down.
Omega-3s → Fight systemic inflammation, lower triglycerides, keep arteries flexible, enhance hormone receptor function.
Electrolytes/Hydration → Sodium-potassium balance critical for nerve conduction, muscle contraction, blood pressure.

2. HORMONE & TESTOSTERONE STACK:
Ashwagandha KSM-66 (600mg) — reduces cortisol 25-30%, boosts testosterone naturally
Zinc (25-40mg) + Magnesium — direct precursors to testosterone synthesis
Vitamin D3K2 (5,000+ IU) — testosterone production requires adequate Vitamin D
Tongkat Ali (200-400mg) — increases free testosterone by binding SHBG
Fenugreek (500mg) — reduces SHBG, increases free testosterone bioavailability

3. MUSCLE & PERFORMANCE STACK:
Creatine Monohydrate (5g daily) — #1 evidence-backed supplement for strength and muscle
Whey Protein (25-40g post-workout) — complete amino acid profile for muscle protein synthesis
HMB (3g daily) — reduces muscle breakdown, preserves mass during cutting
Beta-Alanine (3.2g) — improves muscular endurance

4. RECOVERY & JOINT STACK:
Collagen Peptides (10-15g) + Vitamin C — joint repair and tendon health
Turmeric/Curcumin (500-1,000mg with piperine) — systemic anti-inflammatory
Glucosamine/Chondroitin — joint cartilage support
MSM (1,000-2,000mg) — reduces joint pain and inflammation

5. FAT LOSS & METABOLIC STACK:
Berberine (500mg 3x daily) — blood sugar regulation, insulin sensitivity (as effective as metformin)
CLA (3g daily) — reduces body fat, preserves lean muscle
Green Tea Extract/EGCG — mild thermogenic, antioxidant protection
Fiber (psyllium husk, 10g) — reduces hunger, stabilizes blood sugar, gut health`,
    protocol: [
      `MORNING: D3K2 + Magnesium + Omega-3 + B-Complex + Ashwagandha`,
      `PRE-WORKOUT: Creatine + Electrolytes`,

    content: `PROTEIN POWDER & CLEAN SUPPLEMENT GUIDE FOR MEN OVER 40
(Funk Roberts — Over 40 Alpha Supplements)

WHY PROTEIN IS THE #1 SUPPLEMENT PRIORITY AFTER 40:
After 40, muscle protein synthesis declines and the anabolic response to protein weakens. To preserve and build muscle you need higher protein intake — 0.8-1.2g per pound of bodyweight daily. Most men don't hit this through food alone. Protein powder fills the gap.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A CLEAN PROTEIN POWDER:
✓ Whey protein isolate or concentrate from grass-fed cows
✓ 25-30g protein per serving
✓ Minimal ingredients — ideally under 10
✓ No artificial sweeteners (sucralose, aspartame, acesulfame K)
✓ No fillers, gums, or unnecessary additives
✓ Digestive enzymes (lactase, protease) for better absorption

WHAT TO AVOID:
✗ Soy lecithin — processed additive with no muscle/recovery benefit, can cause digestive issues
✗ Proprietary blends — hide cheap protein amounts
✗ Mass-market powders with artificial colors and flavors
✗ Cheap protein blends (collagen counted as protein)

FUNK'S ALPHA WHEY ARMOR APPROACH:
Designed specifically for men over 40: cleaner formulation, easier to digest, built for lean muscle, recovery, and hormonal performance. No soy lecithin, no artificial sweeteners, enzyme-enhanced.

SUPPLEMENT Q&A — SOY LECITHIN:
Soy lecithin is added to improve texture and mixability, NOT for health benefit. While it's not highly harmful, it's a processing additive. The concern: many powders containing soy lecithin also have artificial sweeteners and fillers. Men with soy sensitivity should avoid.

PROTEIN TIMING FOR MEN OVER 40:
• 30-40g within 30-60 min post-workout (the muscle protein synthesis window is blunted after 40 — don't skip this)
• Morning: 30-40g at breakfast to stop overnight muscle catabolism
• Before bed: 20-30g casein protein to provide slow-release amino acids overnight`,
    protocol: [
      `Target 0.8-1.2g protein per pound bodyweight daily`,
      `Post-workout: 30-40g whey protein within 30-60 min`,
      `Morning: 30-40g protein at breakfast — stops overnight catabolism`,
      `Pre-sleep: 20-30g casein protein for overnight muscle repair`,
      `Choose protein powders with <10 ingredients, no artificial sweeteners`,
      `Look for digestive enzymes in formula — critical for men over 40's absorption`,
      `Avoid powders with soy lecithin, artificial colors, or proprietary blends`,

    content: `MEDITATION FOR MEN OVER 40 — The Complete Framework

WHY MEDITATION IS A PERFORMANCE TOOL FOR MEN:
Meditation isn't mystical or spiritual fluff — it's brain training. Just as lifting weights builds muscle, meditation builds the mental muscle of focus, self-regulation, and stress resilience. For men over 40, it directly lowers cortisol, which means directly supporting testosterone.

THE SCIENCE OF MEDITATION AND MEN'S HEALTH:
• Reduces cortisol and chronic stress response
• Increases gray matter density in the prefrontal cortex (decision-making, focus)
• Decreases amygdala reactivity (fear, anxiety, emotional overreaction)
• Improves heart rate variability — the key marker of recovery capacity
• Reduces systemic inflammation markers (CRP, IL-6)
• Improves sleep quality and testosterone production

5 MYTHS ABOUT MEDITATION (BUSTED):
Myth 1: 'You have to empty your mind' — WRONG. The practice IS noticing thoughts and returning attention. Every redirect is a mental rep.
Myth 2: 'It takes hours a day' — WRONG. 5-10 minutes daily produces measurable brain changes.
Myth 3: 'It's only for spiritual people' — WRONG. Elite athletes, military operators, and CEOs use it.
Myth 4: 'I'm too busy' — WRONG. Men who meditate report getting MORE done with LESS stress.
Myth 5: 'If I fall asleep, I'm doing it wrong' — WRONG. Rest is part of the practice.

THE 5-MINUTE MEDITATION PROTOCOL FOR BUSY MEN:
1. Set a timer for 5 minutes — remove time pressure
2. Sit upright (don't lie down) — alert relaxation
3. Close eyes, take 3 deep breaths to transition
4. Focus on the sensation of breathing at the nostrils or chest
5. When thoughts arise (they will), notice without judgment and return to breath
6. At timer — open eyes, take 1 intentional breath before moving

WHEN TO MEDITATE:
• Morning: Sets calm, focused tone for the day — reduces cortisol spike after waking
• Pre-workout: 5 min focused breathing improves performance and mind-muscle connection
• Post-workout: Accelerates parasympathetic recovery
• Before bed: Most powerful — lowers cortisol, raises melatonin, improves sleep quality`,

      `Start with 5 minutes daily — morning is ideal`,
      `Sit upright, set a timer, close eyes, take 3 deep breaths`,

THE 21-DAY ALPHA MEDITATION CHALLENGE:
Funk Roberts' structured 21-day program to build a daily meditation habit. Covers 7 different meditation styles over 3 weeks, building from foundation to mastery.

WEEK 1 — Foundation (Days 1-7): Focused attention meditation. Learning to use the breath as an anchor. 5-10 min sessions. Goal: build the daily habit and understand the basic technique.

WEEK 2 — Deepening (Days 8-14): Body scan meditation + loving-kindness meditation. Releases held tension in the body. Builds self-compassion and reduces emotional reactivity.

WEEK 3 — Integration (Days 15-21): Visualization + gratitude meditation + open awareness. Using meditation to connect with purpose, vision, and gratitude for life in the second half.

LOVING-KINDNESS MEDITATION PROTOCOL:
1. Close eyes, take 3 deep breaths
2. Bring to mind someone you love easily — feel that warmth
3. Direct these phrases to them: 'May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you live with ease.'
4. Expand to yourself: 'May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I live with ease.'
5. Expand to neutral people, then difficult people, then all beings
Result: Reduces cortisol, increases oxytocin, improves heart health and relationship quality.

SELF-INQUIRY MEDITATION:
Sit quietly and ask: 'Who am I beyond my roles and responsibilities?' Notice the witness behind all thoughts. This practice builds identity stability — crucial for men over 40 navigating life transitions.

SURRENDER MEDITATION:
Actively release control of outcomes during meditation. Breathe in acceptance, breathe out resistance. Statement: 'I release what I cannot control. I act on what I can. I trust the process.'

GRATITUDE MEDITATION:
Spend 5 min mentally reviewing 3 specific things you're grateful for — vivid and detailed, not generic. Gratitude activates the prefrontal cortex and reduces the brain's default threat-detection mode.

POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY MODULE (Funk Roberts):
8-week framework covering: optimism training, resilience building, strength identification, positive relationships, mindfulness and flow, finding meaning and purpose in the second half of life.`,
    protocol: [
      `21-Day Challenge: 5-10 min daily — track every session`,
      `Week 1: Focused attention on breath (5-10 min)`,

    content: `POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY & GRATITUDE FOR MEN OVER 40

WHY POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY MATTERS IN THE SECOND HALF:
Men over 40 often operate from a deficit mindset — focusing on what's lost (youth, hormones, speed, opportunity). Positive psychology retrains the brain to scan for resources, strengths, and possibilities. This isn't toxic positivity — it's neurological reprogramming.

THE SCIENCE:
• Gratitude practice activates the prefrontal cortex — the same region responsible for discipline and decision-making
• Regular gratitude reduces cortisol by up to 23%
• Optimistic men have better cardiovascular outcomes, stronger immune function, and live longer
• Resilience is trainable — it's a skill, not a personality trait

THE 8-WEEK POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY MODULE:
Week 1: Introduction to positive psychology + personal happiness/wellbeing assessment
Week 2: The science of optimism — cognitive restructuring, reframing negative scenarios
Week 3: Resilience — strategies for bouncing back from adversity; analyze past challenges
Week 4: The Happiness Advantage — using positive emotions to improve performance
Week 5: Strengths and virtues — identify personal strengths, apply in daily life
Week 6: Positive relationships — build and maintain meaningful connections
Week 7: Mindfulness and flow — find your flow activities and daily mindfulness practice
Week 8: Meaning and purpose — craft your personal mission statement for the second half

DAILY GRATITUDE PROTOCOL:
Morning: Write 3 specific things you're grateful for (vivid, not generic). 'I'm grateful for my health' is weak. 'I'm grateful for the fact that I woke up today and my legs work and I can train' is powerful.

Evening: Write 1 thing that went well today + what you did to make it happen. This trains the brain to attribute good outcomes to your actions (internal locus of control).

THE RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK:
1. Acknowledge the difficulty — don't minimize it
2. Identify what you can control vs. what you can't
3. Find the growth opportunity in the challenge
4. Take one concrete action forward
5. Seek support — resilience is not done alone`,
    protocol: [
      `Morning: Write 3 specific, vivid gratitudes — not generic`,
      `Evening: 1 thing that went well + what YOU did to make it happen`,
      `Weekly: Identify your top 3 personal strengths and how you used them`,
      `Monthly: Review and update your personal mission statement`,
      `Daily: Reframe one negative situation — what is it teaching you?`,
      `Build positive male relationships — schedule connection intentionally`,

    content: `SLEEP SCIENCE FOR MEN OVER 40 — How Sleep Deprivation Destroys Your Body

THE FOUR HORMONAL DISASTERS FROM POOR SLEEP:

1. TESTOSTERONE COLLAPSE:
Research shows that just ONE WEEK of sleep deprivation leaves men with testosterone levels equivalent to a man 10-15 years older. This isn't gradual — it's rapid and severe. Without optimal testosterone, it becomes harder to stay lean, build muscle, and maintain drive and motivation.

2. IMPAIRED GLUCOSE CONTROL:
Poor sleep destroys how your body handles glucose. With good glucose control, carbs go into muscle tissue for repair and energy. With poor sleep-induced insulin resistance, the same carbs go straight to body fat — especially VISCERAL (belly) fat around the organs. This is why many men gain fat rapidly when they're sleep-deprived despite not changing their diet.

3. ELEVATED CORTISOL:
Sleep deprivation directly spikes cortisol — the tissue-breaking, muscle-destroying, fat-storing stress hormone. High cortisol means: muscle loss, belly fat accumulation, testosterone suppression, and impaired recovery. The more you train without adequate sleep, the more cortisol dominates.

4. GHRELIN & LEPTIN DISRUPTION:
Ghrelin (hunger hormone) rises without adequate sleep — you eat more. Leptin (fullness hormone) falls — you don't feel satisfied. The result: uncontrollable hunger, carb cravings, and weight gain that feels impossible to stop.

WHAT 7+ HOURS DOES FOR MEN OVER 40:
• Maximizes testosterone production (90% produced during sleep)
• Maintains insulin sensitivity — carbs fuel muscle, not fat
• Normalizes cortisol — allows recovery and muscle building
• Regulates appetite hormones — makes healthy eating easier
• Releases Growth Hormone — the anti-aging, fat-burning, muscle-building hormone
• Clears amyloid plaques from the brain — reduces Alzheimer's risk`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.526) All right, guys, today I'm joined by someone who I truly respect and has dedicated his life to helping fathers and men over 40, reclaim their health, reclaim their strength, energy and longevity. Today I'm happy to introduce Dr. Anthony Balduzzi, who holds dual degrees in nutrition and neuroscience from the University of Pennsylvania, a doctorate in naturopathic medicine and is also a national champion bodybuilder. Anthony is the founder of the Fit Father and Fit Mother Project. two of the largest and most respected online health and fitness communities and programs specifically designed for busy parents over the age of 40 who want to lose weight, who want to regain energy, build strength and live healthier lives for their families. And what makes Anthony's mission very powerful is that it comes from a personal experience. After losing his father at the age of 42 to health complications, Anthony's made it his life's purpose to help dads avoid the same path and create healthier future for themselves and their children. And for the past 15 years, he's worked You know, specifically with this demographic helping over 10,000 men collectively lose probably a hundred thousand pounds and more with the Fit Father Project. But what I respect the most about Anthony is that he understands the real struggles that men over 40 face. So today we're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about how you can lose weight, build strength, optimize your health and create a body and life that lasts for decades. Today, I'm excited to introduce Dr. Anthony Balduzzi. Anthony, welcome to this Men Over 40 Summit Session. How are you brother? Dr. Anthony Balduzzi (01:24.037) I'm doing great, Funk. Thanks for having me. It's so good that we get to collaborate in this platform. Like we've been doing this work together for so long and there's so much wisdom here. And that introduction got me pumped up to just reflect on my experience, share and help the guys who are listening. So I'm really happy to be here. Funk Roberts (01:40.75) Amazing, Why don't we start here? Why don't we start a little bit with your story, right? How did losing your father at such a young age shape your mission and the passion for helping fathers over the age of 40? Dr. Anthony Balduzzi (01:50.599) Sure. I want to be quick on this. Many people have probably heard my personal story. You know, I grew up in upstate New York and my dad was working in a hustle and bustle East Coast culture. He was in the computer leasing industry when that was blowing up in corporate. He was in sales. He was flying around and I saw him provide for our family financially, know, bust his butt to put food on the table, sleep at the office many nights. We would bring him dinner late and you know, I just`,

He's widely recognized as one of the world's leading experts on muscle building, body optimization, performance, and human potential, known to many as the godfather of intelligent muscle building, as a former IFBB professional bodybuilder, creator of the world-renowned M140 system, founder of muscle intelligence, and the host of one of the top health and performance podcasts in the world. Ben has spent decades studying what truly allows the human body to perform at its highest level. In recent years, Ben has become deeply immersed in the world of optimization, longevity, hormone optimization, and mitochondria, specifically for us men as we get older. And today we're going to talk about his men 4.0 strategy and how you can implement it to get into the best shape of your life moving forward. Ben, welcome to the Men Over 40 Podcast, brother. Or Men Over 40 Summit. Ben Pakulski (00:58.968) Funga, might need to get you to introduce me everywhere I go, man. I think we're gonna have to partner on something. thank you very much. I was very Funk Roberts (01:06.272) I mean nope no problem. This is great. So why don't we let's start here. Let's start with, you know, c becoming four point What does that really mean? 'Cause usually we think about, you know, I'm two point or I'm just upgrading, but what is that four point and and how does that work? Ben Pakulski (01:19.696) So you'll get this, Funk. So, you know, even as as recently as 10 years ago, the healthiest guy you knew, which is probably us, was training every day, you know, was very lean, was sleeping really well, we're eating, you know, the best foods we can find. We're supplementing, we're getting spending time in nature, we're having great sex, we're doing all the things every guy wants, you know, like the healthiest guy I know. And 10 years ago, that was the standard. But now, fast forward 2026 and beyond. The standard is evolved. And if you're someone who's just doing what you think is best, quote unquote, you're, you know, without testing and objectifying everything, you're leaving so much meat on the bone. And so this amazing technology that we have with artificial intelligence and the modern testing parameters we're able to explore, allow us to have what I call precision performance. So it's this evolved version of what the ceiling looks like. Whereas before the healthiest guy, you knew, man, sometimes they drop dead at 55. And you're like, well, how is that possible? Whereas now, if we're actually able to look deeper into what's happening inside my unique physiology and your unique physiology, we can find constraints and opportunities that allow us to unlock greater levels o`,

So the beautiful evolution from 3.0 to 4.0 is this fully measured, integrated version of ourselves. And it's not, it doesn't have to be crazy expensive. It doesn't have to be overwhelming, but it should certainly should be precise. And so the the evolved version of this funk, because as you can imagine, is in the future, probably not far off, we're gonna be able to wake up every day, put a drop of finger onto, excuse me, a drop of blood from our finger onto some technology. And say, good morning, funk. Here's the supplements you should take today. Here's the work that you should do today. Here's what your genes are saying you need right now. Here's what your blood is saying you need right now to optimize your performance. And we're we're way further down that road than most people even recognize. And so for some people, you know, eating some vegetables, eating some protein is a good start. For guys like us, we're like, man, I don't want to waste my time. I don't want to piss away money on supplements, peptides, and things that I'm not sure are working. So if I do a little bit of work on the on the up front, like you know, testing my genetics, testing my blood work. Ben Pakulski (03:45.528) Looking at deeper levels of testing, I could be so much more accurate and precise in the back end. Ben Pakulski (04:18.202) My internet connection crapped up.

Have that baseline of you know, nutrition, workouts. you know your recovery, your sleep. We're always trying to optimize that. And that's always going to change. But one of the most important things for sure is okay, once we have that foundation, now we're always trying to optimize, right? We're trying to be okay now how do I get to that kind of next level, right? Of longevity. And and we're always trying to get better. Like yes, we can we can have that baseline and still stay healthy and look great. But we're men, right? We're we're the guys who want to just like okay. We have all this technology now. We have all of these things that we can use to help us optimize our health and really make it more personalized, right? That's what we want more personalized.

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.586) All right, guys, today we're diving into a topic that every man over 40 is probably thinking about how to stay strong, how to stay sharp, how to be energized and high performing as you age. Because let's get honest, most men over 40 and 50 start to notice the shift, right? Less energy, slower recovery, more aches and pains, brain fog, stubborn belly fat and declining performance. And many guys assume that it's just part of getting older. But today I'm joined by Ben Greenfield. a world renowned health expert, human performance consultant, and New York Times bestselling author, specializing in performance, optimization, and longevity. With a background in sports science and over two decades, well, probably more decades of coaching experience, Ben's worked with elite athletes, high performing entrepreneurs, executives, top performers around the world to help them unlock energy, improve recovery, and maximize both physical and mental performance. Ben Greenfield (00:42.573) Hahaha. Funk Roberts (00:56.258) He's also the author of Boundless and Beyond Training and hosts one of the world's top health podcasts in the world and a co-founder of Kaion and the Life Network, which is a wellness platform focused on helping people optimize mind, body and spirit. Today, we're going to dive into what really, what it really means to optimize the human machine for 40, 50, 60 and beyond. Ben, thanks so much for being here, my brother. Thanks for being part of this, Ben. 40. Good to see you. Ben Greenfield (01:20.718) Hey, Thanks, Funk. This is an exciting topic. I think a meaningful, timely, and exciting topic. So I'm stoked to dive in. Funk Roberts (01:31.584) Yeah, so let's start with what's actually changing in the male body after or before they get to 40 and what should men actually pay attention to? Ben Greenfield (01:41.456) man, how much time we got. So you can kind of chunk this into specific categories. I guess the way that you'd want to think about things is around 35, 40 or so, that's when you start to see a little bit of an endocrine system adjustment, right? So if you look at it from, let's say like an evolutionary biologist's standpoint as men begin to grow older, they become a little less capable of propagating the human species. Testosterone down regulates. Part of that is due to a decrease in the number of or the efficiency of mitochondria, which we may be able to take a deeper dive into later on. But ultimately, long story short is the outcome of that. is typically lower testosterone, in some cases lower progesterone, lower estrogen, and in general a hormonal shift that results in, I would say the most significant thing you notice is slower recovery time and a need for more off days or more easy days, and then secondarily a dro`,

If you've seen him on Instagram, on YouTube, but he's a functional strength and mobility coach. He's literally redefining what it means to move, what it means to train, what it means to stay athletic after 40, 50, 60 and beyond.

Good. So the first thing I want to talk about is I know that when you were younger, you played football, you played sports and you wanted to be you want to be a soldier. But you had an injury. How did that shape kind of who you are today or where you were when you were younger? Bill Maeda (01:09.148) You know, okay, when I was younger, like in my teenage years, I was very aggressive. I wasn't a mean kid, but I just had a lot of energy. had what I guess they call ADHD. Back then they called it hyperkinesis, but yeah, I was definitely hyper. But I had a little problem around the time I hit 14, 15 when I got puberty or something. I grew really fast. And apparently that made my joints kind of loose. And I've always, even now, for my size and whatever, I've always been more flexible than I am strong. So in high school, I tried a little football and I enjoyed it. It wasn't a big passion of mine. I actually liked more individual combat sports, but I thought I'd try football and it was fun. But I remember it was what, Labor Day practice. We had a tackle drill and just three of us all collided at the same time and we spun and I ended up on the bottom. I guess the way the guy landed on top of me might pop my shoulder out. And that ended up kind of doing enough damage where I needed to have surgery. They did what's called a bristol procedure where they took part of my bicep and they restrung it. If I'm getting this correctly, they basically repurposed my bicep as part of a pec muscle. And in order to do that, they had to put in a stainless steel screw, a small one. But then after I graduated from high school, my dream was to be, I grew up in the 80s, so I was very influenced by all the commando and Rambo and`,

He said, this is a peacetime army. We can afford to be selective. Bill Maeda (03:35.419) And I don't think they're saying that now anymore. yeah, back then he literally just sat by said, look, this is a peacetime army. There was no Gulf War even then.

Bill Maeda (04:36.347) You know, that was a little, you know, I had been training since high school. You know, I didn't, for me to even play football, that was kind of a weird thing because I didn't care about sports in high school. To this day, I don't really care about organized sports. I only watched one championship, you know, the fighting, but yeah, I was never really into that. I had always trained, even now to this day. My training revolves around being better at fighting and having the skills of a soldier. Being able to rock and well, I don't run as much now. My knees, I gotta kinda, you know, I gotta go easy on the butt. I still cultivate as much of the attributes of a soldier and a fighter as I can. That's all of my training is built around that. So back then, you know, it was... Indeed, it was pretty disappointing that I couldn't do that. But the only other job, or what I considered a job that I had at the time, was I was already training people in high school. And then when I went to college, I continued training people. And I just enjoyed it. And I didn't even consider it job at the time. was something I was going to do until I got into the military. But then after that, I realized, well, there's no military.

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.686) Hey everybody, welcome to today's Men Over 40 Summit Talk. I'm excited today because today we got Bill Maeda, who's 57 years old. He's a beast. If you've seen him on Instagram, on YouTube, but he's a functional strength and mobility coach. He's literally redefining what it means to move, what it means to train, what it means to stay athletic after 40, 50, 60 and beyond. And you know, for Bill, after overcoming a sport or a sport ending injury, battling stage three colon cancer and rebuilding Bill Maeda (00:14.28) you you Funk Roberts (00:29.292) his life through fitness. He's inspired millions and millions of people. Like I say, just go on Instagram and YouTube and check him out. But he's inspired millions of people through his unconventional approach to strength, movement, and resilience. And I'm incredibly excited to speak with him today. We're gonna talk about all of that and more. Bill, welcome to the Summit Talk. Thank you for being here. Bill Maeda (00:50.769) Thank you, Fon. Pleasure being here. Funk Roberts (00:52.536) Yeah. Good. So the first thing I want to talk about is I know that when you were younger, you played football, you played sports and you wanted to be you want to be a soldier. But you had an injury. How did that shape kind of who you are today or where you were when you were younger? Bill Maeda (01:09.148) You know, okay, when I was younger, like in my teenage years, I was very aggressive. I wasn't a mean kid, but I just had a lot of energy. had what I guess they call ADHD. Back then they called it hyperkinesis, but yeah, I was definitely hyper. But I had a little problem around the time I hit 14, 15 when I got puberty or something. I grew really fast. And apparently that made my joints kind of loose. And I've always, even now, for my size and whatever, I've always been more flexible than I am strong. So in high school, I tried a little football and I enjoyed it. It wasn't a big passion of mine. I actually liked more individual combat sports, but I thought I'd try football and it was fun. But I remember it was what, Labor Day practice. We had a tackle drill and just three of us all collided at the same time and we spun and I ended up on the bottom. I guess the way the guy landed on top of me might pop my shoulder out. And that ended up kind of doing enough damage where I needed to have surgery. They did what's called a bristol procedure where they took part of my bicep and they restrung it. If I'm getting this correctly, they basically repurposed my bicep as part of a pec muscle. And in order to do that, they had to put in a stainless steel screw, a small one. But then after I graduated from high school, my dream was to be, I grew up in the 80s, so I was very influenced by all the commando and Rambo and`,

And I was like, what is a prosthetic? He says, like an artificial limb. said, oh, my limb is quite f***ed up. No, no, you don't understand. That is kind of the same category. We will never take you. He said, this is a peacetime army. We can afford to be selective. Bill Maeda (03:35.419) And I don't think they're saying that now anymore. yeah, back then he literally just sat by said, look, this is a peacetime army. There was no Gulf War even then. I think the biggest thing we had was Grenada at the time. And so that kind of ended my hopes of joining the military. But that was okay. Funk Roberts (04:00.056) So what was, yeah. what, you so you're playing football, you get injured and, and, know, you get the surgery done thinking you're going to, you know, now you want to join the Marines.

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.981) All right, guys, today we're diving into a training method that I believe is incredibly powerful for guys in their 40s, 50s, 60s, and beyond. And that's called power retreat repeat training. Now, as we get older, many men find themselves stuck between two extremes, either doing bodybuilding style workouts that don't really improve your athleticism or conditioning, or you're crushing yourselves with high-intensity workouts that leave you sore, exhausted, or struggling to recover, or even worse, you're probably doing nothing at all. But today's guest has developed a unique approach approach that bridges both. I'm joined by Chris Lopez. Chris is a strength coach, kettlebell specialist, body recomposition expert, and creator of the power retreat repeat training. I gotta get that, which is a system designed to help men build strength, improve conditioning, burn fat, increase athleticism, and move better without spending endless hours in training. What I love about Chris's approach. And his philosophy is that it focuses on building the body that performs rather than just a body that looks good. So, and through his coaching, his programs, his education, Chris has helped thousands of men and women completely transform their physiques while improving mobility, power, endurance, and overall quality of life. And today we're gonna break down exactly what power repeat training is and why kettlebells are so powerful for men over forty. Chris, welcome, my brother. Welcome. How are you? Chris Lopez (01:26.87) What's up brother? I think that's it, right? Like that intro was like golden. w do we need to say anything else? Like we're done. Funk Roberts (01:32.929) You were good. Okay. Thank you very much, everyone. We'll see you next week. Okay. All right. Well, let's start with what's actually start with a big question, right? Like I I I I teed it up. What exactly is power repeat training and how did you come up with this philosophy? Chris Lopez (01:48.034) So power repeat training is essentially exactly like what it says. It's like your your repetitive efforts of repetitive powerful efforts doing it over a period of time, let's say 30 minutes. I I usually only recommend up to 30 minutes for most people. And the reason why, and I I'm gonna preface this by saying I am I I'm a member of Strong First, I I subscribe to their school, I'm an instructor with them as well. So This isn't these aren't my ideas. I like to say that I'm a regurgitator of ideas. I like to take ideas from different elements and different areas of fitness and longevity and and science and you know, take what's useful and discard what I don't think is useful for the particular population that I work with. So power repeat training isn't something that I came up with at all. It'`,

    content: `And then we've kind of taken the the elements of that and developed power repeat training or what I like to call, for my group, we call them polos, power longevity sessions, because that's the primary driver of the sessions themselves is being able to develop power Funk Roberts (03:02.467) Yeah. Chris Lopez (03:09.502) over a period of time, so power endurance over a period of time. And that in turn helps with longevity for guys over fifty, sixty, seventy, forty, fifty, sixty. Yeah. Funk Roberts (03:20.609) Okay. Yeah, let me back up for a second 'cause you you threw in strong first, but most people listening this right now probably have no idea no clue what strong first is. So can you explain what that is and what what that what that's all about? Chris Lopez (03:32.332) Strongfires is just a school of strength. It's a it's a governing body. it was founded by Pavel Satzalin, who was I guess the the godfather of the modern kettlebell kettlebell movement. He was the guy that brought kettlebells to North America or brought the awareness of kettlebells to North America back in the early two thousands, so I would say late nineties. So I've been a subscriber of his teachings and his philosophies for a very long time. Like I think I first got certified in two thousand and eight, under him and kind of Have really espoused what it is that he does in his philosophy primarily because it's very performance-based. You the aesthetics that you get from training the way that I train, that the way that it's taught is a byproduct of being able to perform, being able to stay strong and powerful and you know, be able to, yeah, and the the muscle and the the leanness of all of that is a byproduct of all of it. But it's it's primarily about performance first. Which is kind of how I feel guys our age should be training. Because, you know, we we we always get caught up in like the aesthetic goals and everything. We want to look better, but it's really difficult to measure that. And we don't really know exactly what that looks like or how long it'll take. But when it comes to performance, being able to get stronger, maybe being able to jump higher, being able to last a little bit longer, like endure a little bit longer, having better cardio, that kind of stuff is measurable. And I find like with the guys that I work pro particularly, That stuff is that that's kind of what motivates you, is because you can see the numbers moving. Whereas when it comes to the aesthetic stuff, you know, you gotta wait a little long time for the adaptations to to happen. And sometimes you become demotivated. But the the strength goals and and and the power goals and the performance goals seem to happen a little bit faster, provided that you're training the right way. So I like to say train for p`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.384) All right, everyone, guys. Today's guest is a true icon in the fitness industry and someone who's been inspiring men for more than three decades, if not even more. Clark Bartram. He's a former US Marine, ISA ISSA master trainer, fitness magazine model, television host, best-selling author, and one of the most recognized faces in the in the fitness history in fitness history. Having appeared on more than 130 magazine covers throughout his career. He's also been inducted into the National Fitness Hall of Fame and dedicated his life to helping people become their best version physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. And what I love the most about Clark, even as the bla the white funk Roberts, is that he's not just teaching men right now how to survive in their 40s, 50s, 60s, and beyond, but he's teaching them how to thrive. And through his CBX system, through his maximized man's coaching programs, he's helped men reclaim confidence, naturally optimize their health, improve mindset. and become stronger in every area of their life. And today that's what we're gonna talk about. We're gonna dive into what it truly means to become a maximized men and how you guys listening can regain your strength, your energy, your confidence, and your purse purpose throughout your life. Clark, my brother, welcome to the Men Over Forty Summit. How are you, brother? Clark Bartram (01:15.436) I'm fantastic and I'm excited to be here. This is, I know you've been working on this for a long time, putting in so much effort to do what both you and I do. You're you're the black Clark Bartram, I'm the white Funk Roberts, and together we're Ebony and Ivory working together in perfect harmony, helping men over 40 stay fit, vibrant, young, active, healthy, and all of the above. Funk Roberts (01:40.598) Yeah, so with that, though thank you so much. And with that, I mean, you spent thirty plus years in the fitness industry, probably even younger, and you're fitter today than you've been, you know, than half the men your age and most of the men that are probably listening right now. But what do you believe is the biggest reason so many men lose their health, lose their confidence, and lose their vitality once they hit the age of forty? Clark Bartram (02:03.312) They're building the American dream or the Canadian dream or whatever dream it is that they're living from whatever company or country they're from. They're they're focused on taking care of their family. That's what real men do, right? But there comes a point of diminishing returns where all of that effort comes back to bite them in the ass because they look in the mirror and time has slipped away very quickly and they think to themselves, how in the hell? Did I end up looking and feeling the wa`,

    content: `So some guys watching your summit are gonna be warned early and some guys are gonna be reminded. It's never late, but they're gonna rem be reminded after the fact. So either way, they can move forward. And that's ultimately the bottom line is making a decision, regardless of where you found yourself or why you have found yourself there and taking a step forward. Funk Roberts (03:11.81) Yeah, that that totally makes sense. I like the fact that you said don't beat yourself up because a lot of times we do, right? We beat ourselves up, we live in regret, but knowing that okay, we're here, now we can move forward. But when it comes to, you know, them losing health and confidence, what have you listened listening here? What are some of the common struggles that you see that guys are facing at this point? Like what are the common goals that they have or struggles that they're facing? Clark Bartram (03:35.258) The common goals, unfortunately, they put the aesthetic first. Most guys, they come to my program, they come to your program, and they say, I want six-pack abs. That should be the byproduct of living a healthy lifestyle. So once we talk them out of that or making that the prime mover in what it is they're doing, the goal should be the next blood test being you get all the right scores. Everything comes out. Funk Roberts (03:39.587) Yeah. Clark Bartram (04:01.2) the way they should come out. And then from there, understanding that if you're moving those markers, your body aesthetically is naturally gonna follow. So what you and I have to Do with these guys is kind of switch the narrative for them and help them put that aesthetic on the back burner, which that will come, but put all of the data on the front end and the things that actually matter: the health markers, the energy, the vitality, the mindset, the attitude towards life. Those aren't the sexy things. Those aren't the things that get the compliments, but those are the things that. Go back to what you said to my group years ago, they're the why that will make you cry. They're the thing that will stick with you when you don't see the aesthetic fast enough. You tend to give up or go to the next coach or try the next biohack or whatever it is. So that that's the thing that guys want. They want the look. And I get it because we both have that look. And that's our hook. The look is the hook. that's I like that. So Funk Roberts (05:03.032) Mm. I like that too. Clark Bartram (05:06.298) You know, and but we're smart enough to know that when we start coaching these guys, okay, now that we've got in our our fishbowl, we have to kind of change the way they're approaching this because that ain't gonna last, man. It ain't. Funk Roberts (05:20.534) Yeah, I think and I think, you know, from from the me, you k`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.181) right guys, we're diving into a topic that every man over 40 deals with at some point, and that's pain. Whether it's bad shoulders, whether it's cranky knees, whether it's low back pain, old injuries, stiffness, or just feeling beat up from years of training or life. Pain has a way of making men over 40 feel older than they actually are. And unfortunately, a lot of guys think pain means you stop training, you avoid movement, or you take it easy forever. But today's guest, is completely gonna change the way you think about pain, injuries, and training after the age of 40. I'm joined by Dean Somerset, a kinesiologist, clinical exercise physiologist, international speaker, educator, and one of the leading experts in training around pain and injuries. Dean has worked with everyone from Olympic and Paralympic athletes to everyday people dealing with chronic pain and post-rehab injuries and issues. He's been featured in T Nation, Men's Health, Women's Health, and countless major publications for his practical, intelligent approach to helping people train while still respecting the realities of pain and injury. What I respect the most about Dean is that he doesn't promote fear-based movement. He actually teaches people how to understand pain, adapt intelligently, and continue building strength, resilience, and confidence without feeling fragile and broken. So today we're gonna talk about how men over 40 can train around pain, understanding what pain actually means, and avoiding unnecessary setbacks to continue getting stronger. Dean, thank you so much and welcome. to the Men Over 40 Summit. Dean Somerset (01:29.358) Absolutely pleasure, glad to be here. Funk Roberts (01:31.869) Yeah, thanks for thanks for being here. So let's why don't we start here when we start with where do you think trainers and also everyday guys go wrong when it comes to pain and injuries? Dean Somerset (01:43.118) think it comes down to kind of two different camps. There's going to be the people who want to say you shouldn't hurt no matter what you do. And if there is even an inch of discomfort in exercise or life in general that you're doing something wrong. And we just know that that's not really the case, especially when people have more training mileage under their belt. You're going to have things pop up. You're going to have aches and pains. You're going to have sore tendons. You're to have cranky joints. You're to have muscles that are still recovering from the previous workout. So being completely pain free is probably not the only way you can exist. That doesn't mean that you can't do stuff to make your overall situation feel better, like doing better recovery, doing better mobility work, doing better progressions with your strength training, doing b`,

    content: `So the challenge is what is the middle ground actually supposed to look like? Should you listen to it? Absolutely. It's telling you something that you need to address. The louder it starts talking to you, the more you need to address it specifically. But it doesn't mean that you need to avoid everything in order to do it. You can still train like an animal into your 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond. I've got clients in their 80s who were deadlifting more than their body weight routinely. And it's not to say that they don't hurt or have aches and pains, but we have conversations about what those aches and pains mean and whether they should be something we address or it should be something that we adjust. Once we get to that understanding, when they're willing to train hard and do stuff, But then when something happens where they're like, Ooh, I was a bit more sore from this workout. They've got tools to be able to deal with it. Funk Roberts (03:18.281) Yeah, definitely. mean, I think it's, the, the, once you feel pain, you know, the last thing you want to do is train around it specifically when you don't understand how you got that pain or injury or, you know, where, know, or, or what to do. Like, you know, you don't want to make it worse, but then, there's the other guys who, know, that ego keeps them going and they kind of, you know, adjust the exercise a little bit, but still don't deal with the pain. we're always told to like, if it hurts, you feel any pain. You know, refer for trainers to refer out, right? But that's not always possible or necessary. Let's go to the trainer side. When should a trainer refer out and which, when should they train just to adapt the program? Dean Somerset (03:59.362) Really good question. So for trainers, the concept of referral is something that they fear a lot because they think they're going to lose the clients out of it. So a lot of trainers that I talked to were very hesitant to refer to a doctor, a physiotherapist or anything like that. But also when you refer out those individuals, those professionals will usually charge money because they're professionals. They went through school for a long time to get good at what they're doing. So that's just going to be an added expense on that individual. When you should refer out is when something big changes. So sudden loss of strength, sudden new pain that was never there before, some function that they can't do anymore or something that's changed their ability to perform an exercise. When you don't need to refer out is when nothing has changed. So let's say somebody has osteoarthritis on their knee and you can make them move. You didn't change their osteoarthritis, you didn't make it better, but they're probably gonna be a little bit more sore from, or somebody has a cranky `,

He is my friend, Eddie Panting, who I've actually shared a stage with at CanFit Pro, but Eddie's a regional manager at Good Life Fitness. He's in a combat sports sports coach and a lifelong student of philosophy and a man who truly embodies what it means to do the work physically, mentally, and emotionally. Now Eddie's journey hasn't been easy. He's faced real adversity, including time spent in federal prison. But instead of being defined by his past, he uses it as fuel to completely transform his life, which is one of the reasons why I respect them very much today. He's a leader. He's a mentor. He's someone who spends a lot of time with men to help them build discipline, resilience and purpose through fitness, through coaching and personal growth. And what I love the most about Eddie is he's a straight shooter, man. There's no fluff. There's no filters. There's pure truth. And when it comes to men's mental health, this is a conversation I think that needs to be had, ever more than ever before. So we're to dive into purpose. We're going to dive into mindset, mental strength, and what it takes for men over the age of 40, 50, 60 and beyond to show up, to take ownership and become the man they're meant to be. This is going to be a very powerful one and enjoyable one. Welcome Eddie P what's going on brother? How are you doing today? Eddie Panting (01:20.393) Man, I'm doing great. That's quite the intro, but I appreciate it, man. Yeah, it's an absolute honour and privilege, one, to know you, to be here, and people who say don't meet your heroes are full of shit, man, because I've been pumped to be around you for a while now, man.

You you've lived a life that most people couldn't even imagine, I'm sure. So take us back to where it all started and kind of what shaped you early on. Eddie Panting (01:56.359) Yeah, so I'm from Winnipeg, Manitoba. So I grew up for our American audience, that's like the Detroit of Canada, we like to call it. So we, yeah, I grew up like lower middle class. I have great parents, like... You know, I grew up in the 90s. I'm born in the 80s, grew up in the 90s, so lower middle class family, they all both had to work, right? So you're kind of raising yourself, you know how that goes. What do they call this? Latchkey kids or whatever, you come home, cook for yourself, take care of yourself, do this stuff. Yeah, and I grew up where sports was my whole life. It was a big priority for me.

Like they get involved really young and I was always on the periphery of that because I had sports, I had athletics to focus on. throughout high school, same kind of thing, getting in trouble, getting arrested, getting like the small stuff was starting to build but it was, I had just enough to keep me dialed in on something else. I had sports, right? And... So fast forward into my kind of early 20s, but I was always hanging out. I was always hanging out with thugs. I was always around gangsters. I was always partying and in the scene with, again, my big homies, my big cousins from the neighborhood were all really prominent, very prominent gang members where I was from. so I just, I was always around and I really looked up to them. I really idolized them a lot. Eddie Panting (03:54.717) And some of them, they had good qualities. Like they really did. They had some bad qualities, obviously, but they also had, they had some good qualities. I've said it before and I say it proudly, like I was raised by wolves. I was raised by guys, my father included, who's a very good man, but the men I looked up to, both coaches, guys from the street, big, like. It was all about accountability, about having principles, about standing for who you are, about having something to stand up for and having respect for yourself and carrying... that you're a reflection of the people that are responsible for you and so you should act accordingly. Right? Like, you know, when I'm out, if I'm somewhere with you, I'm not just a reflection of myself, I'm a reflection of you. Right? So there were some things to really live by and hard work was not an option. It was a non-negotiable in my household. Like, you had to work, my parents had to work, I had to put in hard work. So we, as I was growing up, again, sports was a big deal. I was competing at a really high level in combat sports, competing at a really high level in football, trying to manage both. injuries started to pile up, injuries that I couldn't really start to overcome. And it really dashed my dreams of my pro fight career was getting destroyed. I was really chasing a CFL career, which was a pipe dream, but I was good. I wasn't great. but I really thought I could work my ass off and get somewhere and the injuries started to pile up and I moved back home. I was living in British Columbia, playing football and fighting out there and I moved back and I didn't know who I was, man. I didn't know who I was without... Eddie Panting (05:45.127) that anchor to keep me dialed in on something. So the only other part of myself that I knew was that street guy, right? Was the guy who was out hanging around and so the opportunities provided themselves. And I just got back to hanging out with my older cousins,`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.65) All right, guys, we're talking, welcome again to this session. Today, we're gonna talk about something that every man over 40, 50, 60 seriously needs to think about. That's martial arts, self-defense, confidence, discipline, mindset, and learning how to become dangerous in a controlled way, but more than just physical. Because let's get honest, a lot of men think they know how to fight, a lot of men think that they can protect themselves until they actually have to. And in today's world, a lot of men are disconnected from the physical challenge, the mental challenge, the real world confidence and discipline. That's why I'm excited today to bring on my, and I'm joined by Faraz Zahabi, one of the most respected martial arts coaches in the world and the minds and minds in the world. Faraz is the owner and head coach of the legendary TriStar Gym in Montreal, a long time coach of UFC Hall of Famer, George St. Pierre, widely considered one of the greatest martial artists of all time. Faraz is also known around the world, not only for just producing elite fighters, but his intelligent, technical, philosophical approach to training, mindset, longevity, conditioning, recovery, and martial arts mastery. His coaching philosophy has shaped champions in the UFC, Bellator, and professional combat sports for decades. And what I respect the most about Faraz is that he teaches martial arts as more than just fighting, right? It's about discipline, it's about humility, it's about self-control, resilience, confidence, and longevity. So today we're gonna dive into martial arts training for men over 40, why we think it's... very important to implement it, but not just the physical, the mindset as well. For us, thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much for being part of the summit. Firas Zahabi (01:38.274) Thank you man, thanks for having me and just for the record guys I'm 46 I'm 46 now and I still wrestle every day I do jiu-jitsu every day I'm a black belt in jiu-jitsu for many years I box, I go with professional fighters still young guns guys competing at the highest level I still scrap with them at the gym okay because I'm gonna tell you one thing funk one thing getting old is for people who don't know better If you get old, it's because you don't know better. We know so much about fitness and nutrition. know so fitness and nutrition has exponentially advanced in the last few decades. And now information is everywhere. Like one of your course, know, somebody taking this course can turn the clock back. We have now secret weapons against aging. We can do things guys at forty six. It's you're over the hill. Not anymore. Maybe. You know, you know, like sometimes my students, you know, we joke around. They tell me a little bit old. I'm like`,

    content: `I don't know when it's going to hit me. And I'm sure it's going to hit me sooner or later. But getting old is a myth. And we know better now. We know so much about hormones. We know so much about nutrition. We know so much about fitness. There is no excuse to get old beyond your years. at 46, 46 should be the new 36. 36 should be the new 26. With what we know now, we're gonna talk about it now. We're gonna move forward. We're gonna talk about what are the number one weapons, okay, to not getting old. Okay, number one, guys, number one, me, I act my age. I'm 46. I tell my wife, I don't wanna go anywhere noisy. I'm 46, I don't wanna hear music and loud. No, no, I'm my age, guys, I wanna age. But my body has to function. like when I was 20. And that's why I tell people, look, because of my diet and exercise and my mindset, my body still functions like when I was in my 20s. Okay, so we're going to talk about that. think the number one thing is don't let people convince you, you got old. Just because the rest of the population got old and they slowed down doesn't mean we have to. We know better. We believe in science and technology. We believe in advancements. And there are many secret weapons that we're going to talk about in this video, in this segment right now. And number one is your mindset. Firas Zahabi (04:01.23) Okay, number one, your mindset has to be bulletproof. Once you start convincing yourself you're old, I'm gonna take the elevator because I'm getting old, my knees, my, that's all BS. Don't let those ideas seep into your head, telling yourself, you know, I have so many friends my age. They convince themselves they can't anymore. They convince themselves they can't do this or they can't do that or they can't go hiking like they used to, they can't play hockey like they used to and their shoulders hurting. Guys, I also have a program called Strong and Stable for Life. I'm a big believer in joint health. Okay, we're talk about joint health. There's so much science and technology about joint health. There's so much to know about joint health. There's no reason why your shoulders should be aching, your back should be aching, your knee should be aching. There's a way to fix it all. Okay, so number one thing I will tell you is the mindset. You have to believe it's true. You have to believe there are answers to your questions. Okay, now I'll tell you, Funk, my number one weapon against aging, my number one weapon. is intermittent fasting. That's number one. I think you should eat one to two meals a day. Okay, the studies are incredible on this. Okay, their studies are never ending. If you go into autophagy, if you fast for about 16 hours, your body will eat all the bad cells in your body. Okay, this is not me that discovered this. This somebody who`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.846) All right, guys, this is a conversation a lot of men need, but not a lot of men are having. Today I'm joined by Frank Rich. He's a renowned bodybuilder, entrepreneur, men's health and recovery coach, and the founder of Rebuild Man. Frank's journey is powerful. After battling addiction, depression, and anxiety for nearly two decades, he completely rebuilt his life and now dedicates his mission to helping men over 40, 50, 60, and men in general to do the same. But what makes Frank different is how he approaches porn addiction. Instead of looking porn, looking at porn addiction as just willpower and discipline issue, he refrains it as a nervous system and brain based challenge and gives men a real path to break free, rebuild their identity and take control of their lives. And today we're going to have an honest, real conversation about how to quit porn and rebuild your life, how it's affecting men over 40, 50 and 60, and most importantly, how to fix it. Frank, welcome to the summit, my brother. Coach Frank (00:59.048) Fonk, my brother, grateful and honored to be here, man. What an incredible event you guys are putting on. Funk Roberts (01:04.174) I appreciate you. I appreciate it. And I appreciate you being here. All right. So let's dive into this because this is definitely a taboo topic that most men don't like talking about, but most men think porn is just a habit or a lack of discipline, I'm assuming. But do you say it's deeper than that? What's, really going on right now with, with men and porn and that addiction. Coach Frank (01:21.798) Yeah, it's much deeper, man. You know, we've been incredibly honored over the last six years in our work with the Rebuild Man to work with some incredibly successful people. We're talking some of the top entrepreneurs in the country and the world, pro athletes, guys that are crushing it on Wall Street, guys that are in the operating room working on saving people's lives. You know, many successful people. And I think for a long time when I first got into this work, there was this portrayal and image kind of socially that the guy that struggled with porn was kind of the guy that was living in his mom's basement, right? The guy that wasn't really out there doing anything, whether he was 40, 50, 60, it didn't matter. The guy didn't have a whole lot going on. But what I quickly realized, and this was my story as well, is a lot of guys that are driven, that are high performers, that are building great lives, that are leading families, they bottle up their stress. They don't have an outlet that they can go to. You know, it's kind of been preached to men that You don't have feelings or you shouldn't have feelings and with the average age of exposure to porn being somewhere between 8 to 11 years old `,

    content: `Maybe they found their dad's cassette tapes, right? You know, maybe they had to access skin and acts online, you know late at night when their parents were asleep. But because porn was normalized to that generation when the internet came around it was almost as if they were given this drug without understanding the real danger behind it. So what we've seen is a lot of guys in this demographic are winning in life they have incredible success on the outside but because porn was so normalized and they didn't understand the real implications behind it it quickly started to take over their lives. So it's much deeper than a Funk Roberts (03:14.19) Thank Coach Frank (03:14.78) Habit, it's much deeper than a need of having more discipline or willpower because some of the most disciplined and driven people in the world are struggling with this. Funk Roberts (03:22.99) Yeah, I'm glad you said that. Like for me, if I just kind of like, because I'm fit right here, I'm 57 years old. And I know that for us, you know, growing up, porn was like, like you had to you had to search for it, right? Like it wasn't available. You could go to the store to get the magazines. My father was a porn connoisseur. So like, I mean, we would leave, we would leave our house, school, come to my house and watch a watch a movie. Because porn in the 80s, there were movies. Right. So you sit down and you literally watch a movie. Coach Frank (03:34.878) Mm-hmm. Coach Frank (03:52.254) Mm-hmm. Funk Roberts (03:53.078) as opposed to what we, what we have now. So it was, it was kind of like, my dad, you'd have to, you know, get it on cable and then, and then in the nineties, you'd have to go to the store, right? So you have to walk into the blockbuster or whatever, and you go to the store. So there was always this like, like a whole, like all these barriers and steps to getting on, right? And so, so after that, when, the internet came and, and it became readily available, I think you're absolutely right. It just became like, Coach Frank (04:03.912) Yes. Funk Roberts (04:22.412) It was like, my God, he is almost getting anywhere. Right. And, even, even, even still, like, you know, when I was in my maybe thirties late, yeah, late thirties, I kind of, it just kind of got too crazy, but that's probably because I was also in an active addiction, my active addiction as a, professional athlete and, and in being an active addiction, that this, the, the insects was a big part of my addiction, like anything unborn. I pretty much would have or seen or done like physically, right? So a lot of that, for me, I haven't watched porn in like 10 years. It's just not even possible for me to watch it. doesn't resonate. But I do know that like for our demographic, that explosion of having accessibility like no ot`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.822) All right, everyone. Today we're talking about one of my favorite training tools for men over 40, 50, 60, 70. In fact, one of my own best and favorite training tools. That's the kettlebell. Now, if you've been following me for any length of time, you know how much I believe in kettlebell training. It's one of the most effective ways to build world real world strength, burn fat, improve mobility, increase conditioning, and stay athletic as we ate. And today's guest is one of the world's leaning kettlebell experts. I'm joined by my good friend. Gregory Zamali, founder of Z Libasar Libastark, and the creator of the Kettlebell Code. Now, for nearly a decade, Gregory and his team has helped men over 40 from around the world to regain their strength, to eliminate pain, to improve mobility, to lose fat, build athletic bodies using kettlebell training. And through his coaching, his education, his YouTube channel, which you need to check out, over 200,000 followers, Gregory is known for his practical, effective, and a sustainable approach. To helping people in their forties, fifties, sixties, and and beyond become stronger, powerful, leaner, and pain free without living in the gym. And what I love about Gregory's philosophy is that he focuses on movement, longevity, and capability and not just the aesthetics. Anyways, today we're gonna break down the seven best kettlebell exercises for men over forty and why you should be implementing kettlebell training. Gregory, thank you so much for being part of the summit. How are you, brother? Gregory Dzemaili (01:23.547) Funk, I appreciate you having me. I knew when Funk is calling, I gotta show up because you showed up when I was calling. So I'm a hundred percent down helping the over forty crowd discover one of the most powerful tools that can truly change your life. Funk Roberts (01:41.166) Well let's talk about, let's start there. Why do you think it is one of the most powerful tools, specifically for guys 40s, 50s, 60s, and beyond? Gregory Dzemaili (01:49.244) Here's one key that I discovered, and that is, and I've matter of fact, just a couple of days ago, we had it in our in-house education. So one thing that the kettlebell is not really well, in my circles, yes, but not in the outside circles. It's not really known for its capability to actually train the longevity part, what I call GPP. People just look at kettlebells and they think, well, I do swings if I want to jump higher. Or I use kettlebells if I wanted for some specific area in my sports practice, maybe that replicates the joint action that I then need in my sport or whatever. So, which is fine. But the point that I see that kettlebells do incredibly well is GPP. So, what is GPP? That's called general physical preparedness. That`,

    content: `All these factors that you need, you have to lift up to a certain standards before you can do SPP exercises or specialize in your sport. And so this is where the kettlebell comes in, because the kettlebell, if you use it properly in a proper framework, it does build strength. Because if you press a bell overhead or you squat with it, yes, you're getting there. Well, you can do this with other tools as well. But let me continue. It can really help you with your issues when it comes to pain, for example, in the ligaments or in the joints. Why is that? From a physiotherapist's perspective, if you want to treat joint aches, one thing that is super interesting is concentric training. Eccentric training, I'm sorry. Concentric is when you flex the biceps, right? And eccentric is when you drop it, right? When you let the weight go. The tendons actually love it if you engage in two eccentric movement. Now, what does a swing do? What does a clean do? What does a snatch do? It's continuous, eccentric movements. And where? In the center, in the midsection. This is where we build strength. Now, if you really and truly take the kettlebell for a spin without putting it down, you actually build some endurance. Because if I move a weight continuously, that means my heart rate goes up. Gregory Dzemaili (04:09.977) And if I use it the proper way, that means my endurance systems now get taxed as well. And something that it also does is it improves your mobility. Because as you press the bell overhead, it puts you in strange and awkward positions that your shoulders maybe not used to, which means you're now getting an improvement in an area that you never had before. And the other thing that is super powerful about the kettlebell itself is listen, man, one bell, one square meter, and you can do everything. Swing, press, clean, squat, snatch. Five exercises, you're golden. You never gotta get outside your house again. You do do it in your yard, in your garage, in front of your kids. You're a role model. You can do with your family, be with your wife. Then everybody sees you, like, I want to join in with the fun too. And the unbrokenness of kettlebell training is something that is so incredibly powerful because it eases the mind, which means it's like medication for the mind. If you do 100 swings, 32 clean and jerks, 60 snatch, and 30 squats, and I tell you, Don't put the bell down. This forces resilience. This forces you to pace yourself. This forces you to become one with the bell. So a lot of things are happening which take the kettlebell to a level which just can truly and ultimately change your life. I hope I was making that point clear. Funk Roberts (05:27.038) Yeah, no, that's amazing. And and s you know, the the fact that one piece of equipment, because you mention`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:01.134) Welcome everyone. Welcome everyone to today's talk. This is a special one. Actually today I'm going to be sitting down with a true legend in the world of strength and performance. Dan John. Dan has been spent over six decades lifting, coaching and studying what actually works when it comes to building strength and more importantly, why so many people overcomplicate it from being an all American discus thrower to a Highland games athlete, to an Olympic lifter, to becoming one the most respective coaches and authors in the world. Dan has dedicated his life to simplify strength training so everyday people can actually apply it. And what I do love about Dan, I've been following for many years as he cuts through all the noise, right? All the fluff, all the gimmicks, just simply simplifying the effective train that's gonna help us get stronger, move better and live longer. And in today's session, we're gonna dive into how men over 40, 50 and 60 should be really training and how to let go of the should have, would have, could have mindset and build strength. that actually adds life to our years. Dan, thank you so much for being here, man. I appreciate you. Daniel A John (01:01.604) I'm really glad to be talking to you. was I this is going to be good. I when you sent me the questions, I was like, oh, this is me a fun conversation. So thank you. And thanks for taking the time to think this through. And I really appreciate that. Yeah. Funk Roberts (01:14.158) For sure. For sure. So yeah, let's talk about like how your training has evolved over the years as you have aged, right? Like, you you were younger when you were doing a lot of different types of training, but as you've aged, what has changed? How has your philosophy changed in that sense? Daniel A John (01:29.732) Well, you know, I'm not sure this is gonna sound weird. I'm not sure my philosophy, philosophy has changed. You know what I mean? The tools have changed and maybe the emphasis changed, but you know, my brother had just got home from Vietnam War. It was 1965 and my aunt died and they went, my brothers went to Sears and bought the Sears Barbell 110 pound set, you know? And here's the booklet it came with, okay? This is the book that it came with. Funk Roberts (01:55.726) Daniel A John (01:57.89) Yeah, and Ted Williams workout and you know, I'll look at this. The first two exercises are clean and press and then clean and press, press, press and then curls and then just, you know, dead lifts and just everything. And he recommended two sets of five with practically everything. And it's interesting because that's the template I kind of still use to this day. Now to get... to make that full circle, I made a lot of mistakes, okay? I did some dumb things, so really, and I like w`,

    content: `And it's like John Powell's famous line about disc is throwing. I said it was simple, not easy. Funk Roberts (02:51.318) Yeah. Daniel A John (02:51.428) And I think sometimes what people miss is if you have a simple approach to sleep, nutrition, training, water, relationships, how you treat your neighbors and all the rest, know, life is pretty, honestly, it's pretty simple. Now, Funk Roberts (03:05.069) Thank Daniel A John (03:14.276) to show up in the weight room three days a week for 60 years is a little different. Now that's not the easy part. A lot of things can get in the way. So I would just say this. So when I was thinking about game changers, about the things that changed my career, I would slide back to 1975 when Dick Notmeyer of Blessed Memory taught me how to Olympic lift. And then I'd jump ahead to 2001 when I... broke this wrist really badly, eight pieces. and was told by the doctor I'd never train again, came back, and that's when I learned loaded carries. You know, the farmer walks, a suitcase carries, and all those. A couple of years later, it's funny, because things are starting to accelerate, I met Pavel at a workshop, and he gave me this concept called Easy Strength, which is funny, because Easy Strength is basically what Ted Williams told me. It had been, I heard it in 1965, and I re-heard it in 2004 or five. And then of course after that I started adding kettlebells and in the last couple years in my home gym I've started adding machines because you know as I'm sneaking up on 70 I'll be there very soon That where that happened fast. I'll tell you that man And and the nice thing about all these things is that Daniel A John (04:37.774) The fundamental things, push, pull, hinge, squat, loaded carry, do some mobility work, get your sleep, drink water, eat protein, eat fruit and vegetables, none of that's ever changed. But for me, what has changed is I have a lot more tools than I did back then, and I've gone through a lot of tools, some good, some bad, some miserable. So. I have an overriding principle of funk and it's two words, okay? And then there's an axiom, okay? Everything works. And the funny thing is, if our listeners just got into Pilates, Pilates is great. Yoga, yoga is great. Olympic lifting is great. Powerlifting, bodybuilding. But we just go down, everything works. Everything works. asterisk for about six weeks and then it's time to change and the key I think to long-term success in the weight room and writing and being in relationships is understand that everything works but you have to slightly adapt and you know and the phrase I like so much is same but different and if we get our listeners to lift weights three days a week, get a lot of walking in, eat their protein, their fruits, their veggies, drink water, they wou`,

And that's alignment. And not just physical, but mentally, neurologically, and emotionally. And in a way that the approach is our gonna approach with our overall health. Because the truth is a lot of guys over the age of 40 wake up feeling stiff, older than they should, low energy, stressed, inflamed. disconnected from the body and slowly losing that physical edge that you once had. And today's guest is here to explain why that actually happens. And more importantly, what we can do about it. I'm joined by Dr. Sherry McAllister. She's a president of the foundation of chiropractic progress, the largest chiropractic organization dedicated to public education and awareness. Dr. McAllister is also a doctor of chiropractic with over 25 years of clinical experience and an internationally recognized expert in whole being health. performance optimization, longevity and proactive health.

Dr. McAllister is recognized internationally speaking on five continents and advancing whole being health. performance optimization and proactive approach that helps individuals like you listening improve health span, resilience and the quality of life.

Funk Roberts (02:01.518) No problem. I'm excited here. I'm excited for our talk. So why don't we start here? Why don't we start with why do so many men over the age of 40, 50 and 60 begin feeling older than they actually are? Dr Sherry McAllister (02:11.764) This is one of those things that we never want to feel. And does it creep up on us? Yes. And the actual reasons are we start to accumulate stress, especially after the age of 21. I know most men out there don't want to hear that, but it's a true story. We start to lose our movement because we get into our jobs, become more sitting, we lose our mobility, and then unfortunately we start to lose our strength too. So... After a whi`,

    content: `.. resilience and I think many men thinking out there, well, it's just natural. It actually starts to accumulate over time in the misaligned habits that we have that is either in movement or stress regulation or even recovery. Funk Roberts (03:23.534) Yeah, I know a lot of guys try to like power through everything right here in your 20s. You're focusing on whether it's school or what have you, your 30s. Now it's career, it's family. And so, you you're not really thinking about health or all the things that you're talking about and you're just kind of grinding away. And I'm sure that has an effect on your health and the nervous system and feeling older than you really are. But you also talk about whole being health. I talked about that in the intro. What does that actually mean? And why is it so important for us guys as we get older? Dr Sherry McAllister (03:54.276) We've been really, unfortunately, put in a situation in our health where we're always looking for symptoms. And then we start to think that health is the absence of the symptoms. And that's so far from the truth. When we start really focusing on our capability, we're starting to look at then what does it mean to be truly healthy? Because a healthy body is a body that is physically capable. that is mentally resilient because a lot of us take our mental health for granted. It is part of our physical being. It's just that it happens to be on top of the most important framework ever known to man, which is our shoulders. It's our brain. That's where our nervous system really functions. And we do not understand fully, even to this very day as we're sitting all here listening, how the nervous system completely functions because we don't have a full brain mapping yet. That's coming. I know the world's expert in brain mapping and he is very excited about working with other scientists to really figure out how does the nervous system actually work? How does the brain work? But what really what it gets down to is energy, emotional regulation, and then how we gain the resilience to move through our day through performance is really health. Your body doesn't function in silos and that's where the whole being concept comes from. It means that optimizing the entire system is really crucial for us to be quote unquote at our best or healthy, if you will. Funk Roberts (05:26.786) Yeah, you touched on something there where, you you talked about being healthy is one part of it's being physical, right? And that's what we, think everyone, all of us think about. The only thing we think about if we look good, if we're going to the gym, if we kind of feel good, you know, then we're healthy, right? And I know a lot of guys who are listening, they don't go to the doctors and like seldomly go to their doctors to get b`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.389) All right, guys, today we are diving into a topic that most men in their 40s, 50s, 60s don't really wanna talk about. But it impacts everything that we do and that's our relationships. Because here's the truth, a lot of men spend years optimizing their bodies, they optimize their business, their money, but they completely neglect their love life. Or worse, they hide behind that self-development as an excuse and the cycle goes on for years. So today we're gonna challenge that. I'm joined by Kavita Ajlani. Coach Kavita @dashingdate (00:26.285) Mm. Funk Roberts (00:29.777) founder of Dashing Date and the creator of the Kind King Method, which is a powerful coaching framework that helps men stop sabotaging with women that they actually want and build real committed relationships. Kavita works with men to help them understand women, step into what she calls mountain energy and become the man who doesn't just attract the right woman, but actually keeps her. So today we're going to dive into everything in this conversation, what you're getting wrong, how to build the right relationships. that can actually elevate the second half part of your life with the right woman. Kavita, thank you so much for being here and it's great to see you again. How are you? Coach Kavita @dashingdate (01:07.178) It is so good to see you funk. I am doing great. How are you? Funk Roberts (01:08.605) I'm awesome. I'm awesome again. Just getting, getting, getting, just landing from a long flight, but you're going to carry this, this interview for sure. But, you know, one of the things that, that I want to start with is why do so many men have everything figured out specifically those successful men have everything figured out except the love life or the love portion of their life. Coach Kavita @dashingdate (01:34.24) start by saying that it really is a story first and foremost that you have adopted over time. so if you are someone right now who is caught in that cycle of you know things are going so well, I've got my fitness in check, my career is working, I got friends, families, hobbies, like everything is going well but I can't figure this out. the real first step is like releasing that story. and realizing like, yes, it really is a story and it's something that is being perpetuated by society. Like we are being pushed, it's being pushed on us that there are these different areas of life and that we're supposed to master them in some sort of sequence. And it's because of that that it can feel like you don't have your love life figured out is because we have separated these areas of our life. Fitness lives over here, career and money lives over here, and then love lives all the way over here. And that's what happens is over the years, a lot of the clients `,

    content: `That's the problem. So that's why a lot of people are feeling this way. Funk Roberts (02:53.181) And so with. Yeah. So with that problem, what's the real cost? Because you said that these guys come to you now and they think they have everything on point, but then they believe in their dating on the back burner. What is the real cost that happens to these guys as they get older? Coach Kavita @dashingdate (03:11.182) You know, these other areas of our lives, they are completely in our control. And when you're, as a man, being in your masculine energy really means constantly taking action, pushing forward. What can I do? What's available to me? Like, what is in my control? You want to control it. So it can be really easy to focus entirely on the areas of life that feel like you can conquer alone. Funk Roberts (03:13.71) you Funk Roberts (03:39.334) Mm. Coach Kavita @dashingdate (03:39.864) And when it comes to love and relationships, requires another person. It's this beautiful area of life where we have to approach it in a very different way. Now there's another person involved. There's other people involved. And... What ends up happening is you stay so focused on these areas that you can control and you start to get caught up in this story. Again, coming back to the story that once I get the six pack abs, once my bank account is full, once I have the perfect house, once I, as soon as I, then the woman is just going to somehow show up. It's just going to happen for me. And you also start to cling to this idea that I have to have all these things in order to attract women. We get caught up in this not enoughness. And we get caught up in the highlight reels of everybody else's story of like, well, you have to have this much money. You have to look a certain way. You have to be a certain height. And we're not growing any taller after a certain point. So the men in your demographic, we've reached the points that we've reached. And getting caught up in this I'm not enough until I hit all of these goals. Funk Roberts (04:35.581) Hmm. Coach Kavita @dashingdate (05:01.448) it delays the one thing that is actually the catalyst for hitting all those goals. So the cost is actually slower success. It's being alone. It's not having your provider instincts kick in. It's the carrying the weight of it all rather than actually being in partnership and sharing the difficulties of life, the burdens of life, the challenging periods of our growth journey with actually somebody by our side. Funk Roberts (05:36.86) Mm-hmm. Coach Kavita @dashingdate (05:37.056) So it's having an amazing partner and an amazing woman or wife or girlfriend in your life that is actually the catalyst for success in all other areas.

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.502) Alright, guys, today we're diving into a topic that affects every single man in their 40s, 50s, 60s, and beyond, and that's energy. Because let's be honest, most men don't wake up one day suddenly old. It happens gradually. You notice your energy isn't what it used to be, recovery may take longer, mental clarity starts slipping, inflammation creeps in, and your body just doesn't bounce back the way it used to. And many men, including me, at some point assume that it's just simply aging. But today's guest has a fascinating story because It's something deeper. It's happening at the cellular level. And Ken Schwartz, also known as Ken the Scientist, wasn't working in the health, wasn't working in the health and wellness space at all. He was involved in radiation research, fusion technology, and advanced scientific projects when he experienced a health transformation that changed everything he thought he knew about aging, recovery, and human performance. What started as a scientific curiosity eventually led him down the path of studying oxidative stress. Mitochondrial health, free radicals, inflammation, and the factors that may be accelerating aging in all of us. And today we're gonna dive into this incredible conversation. Thank you, Ken, and welcome to the Men Over 40 Summit. How are you doing today, brother? Kenneth Swartz (01:13.523) doing great and glad to be on your summit. Funk Roberts (01:16.182) Yeah, thank you. Okay, so why don't we start off with you know, let's talk about longevity and cellular health. But before we do that, why don't you tell us about your story and how how you got to where you are today? Kenneth Swartz (01:28.526) Yeah, well, I was actually running the metal oxygen fusion reactor project. And there was a little problem with it. A lot of there's a lot of dead professors and late PhDs associated with this research. And I didn't want my crew or myself to end up on that list. So I went out looking for like extra radiation protection. And I read about this thing called carbon-60. And you know, they had it did some experiments where they got one set of rats, of course, gets carbon-60. The control group doesn't get any, and then they hit them with a fatal dose of radiation. And the C sixty rats live, whilst the control group, of course, died. And so when I read that, I said, I'm gonna get that for my crew and myself. And we're all still alive. And so I guess it worked for that hell that thing. But I kept using it because I had more energy, better mental focus. And just to ground better health. And about seven months after using C sixty, I went in to see my optometrist and my Druze or dry macular degeneration. Had completely disappeared, and my autometrist was pretty surprised about that because he had neve`,

    content: `Yeah, and and and after my experiments, because on the other time, my electrical engineer, Gary Rodriguez, he had developed severe wet macular degeneration. It was so bad that that he was probably have to quit his job as an engineer. So considering that, I made a C60 preparation, MCT coconut oil. He took a a tablespoon a day for about 15 months, and his severe wet macular degeneration went away, completely healed, and his type 2 diabetes, which was the main cause of it, also went subclinical. Funk Roberts (03:10.144) Okay, so we're you talked about carbon sixty. So that's fascinating that you were exposed to this radiation or or potentially exposed to the radiation. And you do some research, you find this carbon sixty, and you're like, all right, no, this this worked with this research. So right away you're like, all right, I'm gonna take it and my team's gonna take it. Like was there were there other research or science behind it, or was it just that one thing that kind of said, you know what, let me just try this for my team and myself to see how this works. Kenneth Swartz (03:39.162) actually, there's a whole bunch of more research behind it. I was just looking for the specific stuff. But I want to look later. basically was discovered in 1986, solved a mystery in astronomy, and then it got a Nobel Prize in 1996 in chemistry, because it's kind of a unique structure. It's like a spherical molecule of carbon, all the same, shaped like a little soccer ball, all the same. And the first the first time to study really that's important is the Botry study. And basically, here's this mysterious molecule discovered in outer space, though it's also found on Earth, and it and it might be toxic, right? So they tested it on whistler rats. Now, whister rats are kind of wimpy rats, right? And they gave it to them, and the whister rats had a 90% increase in their lifespan, primarily because because they were no longer wimpy rats. They lived a normal, really extr extremely long normal rat lifespan, and no cancers, which they usually die of, and other diseases that they're kind of like a rat that kind of ages rapidly. So it just they just didn't age. They just lived a a a long normal rat lifespan. Of course, they did another study. There's another study in there and once they found out it was a superoxide disputase catalase mimic, they did a study with wild type mice. And in these cases wild type mice lived 11% longer and had no cognitive decline during aging. And you know, which is another great thing. Obviously, what good is getting old if you're just drooling in a wheelchair? You know, what C sixty really does increases that health span, you know, the time when you're active and can function rather than just just lifespan. Funk Roberts (05:04.928) Mm-hmm. Funk Rob`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.534) All right, guys, today we're diving into something that every man in their forties, fifties, sixties needs to get right. And that's actually how to train for health performance and longevity, because let's be honest, there's a lot of noise out there right now. You've got social media workouts, you've got biohackers, you've got extreme protocols, and most of it doesn't, doesn't translate to us specifically at our age or to our real life. So we're going to cut through all of that noise. I'm joined by Kevin Carr. a highly respected strength and conditioning coach, educator, and someone who's been in the trenches coaching real people for over 15 years. Kevin is a partner at the Mike Boyle Strength and Conditioning facility, one of the top performance facilities in the world. He's worked with everyone from Olympic athletes to everyday men who just want to get stronger, healthier, and move better. He's also the co-founder of the Certified Functional Strength Coach Certification, founder of Movement as Medicine, and the author of the Functional Training Anatomy book, which is a coming out and focused specifically on training for health and longevity. But what I love about Kevin and my respect about him is he doesn't just talk the theory part. He actually coaches real people every day, every single day and understands what it really takes and what, works for our real life specifically for us guys as we age. So today we're going to break down how to train effectively, how to build strength, how to improve conditioning, how to avoid injury and create a system that keeps you strong, capable and in the game for life. So Kevin, thank you so much for being here welcome to the summit. Kevin Carr (01:31.542) Yeah, Funk, thank you for having me. I love talking about this type of stuff. So it's always a pleasure when I find someone else who's as passionate as I am, who wants to dive into it. Funk Roberts (01:40.234) Awesome. So let's talk about first, you know, a lot of guys feel like their physical years, their best physical years are behind them. I hear that all the time. Specifically, new guys come into my program. What's actually happening to the body and how much of that is really controllable for us. Kevin Carr (01:55.884) Yeah, and so what I always tell people is that time is undefeated. Over time, our body is going to change. And the sooner that we accept that there is a natural decline from who you were at 20 to who you are at 40, then we can start to move beyond that and think about, how can I maximize and still be great and feel great every day when I get up and be able to perform and do the things that I want to do? Because those things are not out of reach. You know, like I said, aging is inevitable, but the type of training that `,

    content: `But you'd really be amazed at simple interventions, lifting two days a week for 30 minutes, putting in a little bit of plyometric and power work, putting in little bit of flexibility work into your program so you're maybe training two 60-minute sessions per week can really level off that decline and have a lot of people actually continue to improve in their 40s, their 50s, their 60s. I regularly see men who we work with at MBSC, who are 60 years old, who say, this is the best that I felt since I was in my 20s. That period of 30, 40, 50, when they weren't exercising was kind of the downturn. And then they get to see a peak later in their life because they dedicated to a program that was well-rounded and balanced and focused on them specifically at their age and the things that they needed. And so, while there's gonna be a kind of a natural biological decline, the environment we create, the intervention that we provide can really change the trajectory of your life and how you feel if you are consistent over the long term. Funk Roberts (03:56.206) Yeah, you you mentioned something about like even in the 60s, you have someone in their 60s who like feels better than they did or just as good as they did in their 20s. And yeah, there's a lot of guys I think who want to get back into shape, who want to get to the gym, who want to train and maybe even try to start. But what are the mistakes that you see guys are making when they're coming in? They're probably telling you, oh yeah, I've been to the gym or I tried this program or this program. Like what are those mistakes? Because I don't think it's out of trying. think it's just those mistakes that we keep making. as we try to get back in the gym. Kevin Carr (04:26.682) Yeah, I think the biggest risk that a lot of guys who are like 40, 50, 60 make is thinking that they're 20. Right. And so they think, oh, well, you know, what did I do when I was, know, in college or what did I do when I was in high school? And it's important to realize you're one, you're not the same person, but two, the science has come a really long way since then. Right. What you were doing in the early nineties is probably not necessarily what we're doing now. And so I would say we want to look at our program as a whole. It's not just, we're going to go back in, do a couple of these little Funk Roberts (04:36.088) You talk. Kevin Carr (04:56.244) know, stretches and then we're going to get on the chest press machine, the leg press machine, do a bunch of sets, sit there and get out of there. We want to think about building a system, right? And that means, you know, following a training recipe that involves, you know, know, five to 10 minutes of active mobility and movement prep, followed by some power and plyometric work to start to get you`,

Today's guest is someone who truly embodies what it means to build strength, resilience, discipline, and complete physical capability. I'm joined by Phil DeRue. Phil is one of the most respected coaches, performance coaches in the world. He's worked with elite UFC champions, professional athletes, military operators, and high level performers across combat sports, football, boxing, and tactical performance, just everyday men and women around the world. He's a former division one football player, professional MMA fighter, and the founder of Daru Strong Performance, one of the top performing training systems in the industry. Phil has also coached world champions like Dustin Poirier, Edson Barbosa, Junior De Santos, and countless elite fighters and athletes around the world. And what I respect the most about Phil is that his philosophy goes beyond just lifting weights and looking good, right? Focusing on... the physical, focusing on the mental, the emotional, the spiritual. The entire system is built around resilience, discipline, movement, recovery, performance, leadership, and becoming capable in your 40s, 50s, 60s, and beyond. And today we're gonna talk about all of that and more. This is gonna be an amazing conversation, rebuilding the man's strength, discipline, and performance over the age of 40. Phil, welcome to the Man Over 40 Summit, my brother. Phil (01:19.726) Oh man, Funk, you're the man, brother. It's just a true legend, by the way. You're true legend. I mean, I remember watching your videos when I was like a teenager, and I'm not trying to age you, brother, because I mean, you've been in it for a long time, and a lot of people don't understand that, you know, I've, I mean, even my entire bodyweight program, I was watching your stuff, you know. So you're the man, bro, and I appreciate that. And now I gotta live up to the hype. This is crazy. Funk Roberts (01:47.35) I appreciate you. And I appreciate you keep doing things for fighters because there's still no one out there other than you that are really helping the combat athletes. And I mean, I know it's everything else, but just there's still that missing piece of more out there information for that. Those guys who are, you know, current fighters, guys who train martial arts or just people who are getting back into martial arts is want to be fit, right? Like you're the only person out there that's doing all of that. So big up to you as well. A hundred percent. I love what you're doing. Phil (02:15.246) Thank you, brother. Thank you. Well, you know, what we're talking about now is men that have stood the test of time, you would say, right? They have gone through the battles, went through the warrior phase, 20s, 30s and beyond.

    content: `And then you start forgetting all those things that allowed you to get to where you wanna be, or they've never done it before. And we're trying to create these new habits. So the biggest thing is figuring out what is most important. Your physical fitness, your ability to be athletic. What I mean by that is being able to move and rotate and run and jump and crawl still until your later years so that... You never lose it, man. And that's the biggest thing and being able to be equipped and able to do things with your grandkids, your kids, whatever it is and never stop. And that allows you to have a better quality of life. You know, I've been able and blessed to be able to work with some high level individuals in their fifties and sixties. And the biggest thing that I would say is they never stop. They never stop moving. They never stopped evolving. They never stopped trying to elevate and adapt. And so it allows them to keep growing as an individual, whether it be learning new things from a physical standpoint, but also psychological, spiritual. mental and that goes hand in hand within my, and I've been doing this for 20 plus years now as a performance coach. And I would say that what I realized was true performance is never really just physical. Again, it is neurological, it's physiological, it's environmental, it's behavioral and it's spiritual. And so you have to be able to constantly understand what is your limiters first and foremost, it comes down to having a proper assessment process, having some goals in mind, obviously, having a guide that can organize your thoughts appropriately and then execute accordingly with maximal intent, but also being able to understand that you're not always going to be 100 % and that's okay. You don't necessarily need to be 100 % to get something done. And so the biggest thing that I've seen, especially working with fighters is that you're never going to come into the weight room or have a day where you feel 110%. Now you can give that 110 % Phil (04:39.894) with the abilities that you have that day, with the readiness that you've acquired through, whether it is internal load or external load, we can organize the training process based upon readiness. And so we have to identify what is that readiness. And for that, that goes into the process of assessments, whether it be using objective and subjective indicators, meaning that maybe you use an HRV monitor. I wear a whoop all the time. have my guys and girls wear whoops or any type of HRV monitor. Funk Roberts (05:08.142) Mm-hmm. Phil (05:09.902) just so that we have some objective data to measure HRV, to measure morning heart rate, to measure strain range, sleep quality. And then you have your subjective indicators, right? How you're feeling, right? Did you sleep well`,

Stefanos, welcome to the Men Over 40 Summit. Thank you for being here, my brother. How are you? Stefanos S Sifandos (01:23.622) Yeah, I'm well man. Thank you and pleasure to be here with you too. Funk Roberts (01:28.268) Amazing. So why don't we start here? Why do so many men struggle emotionally, even if they appear successful on the outside? Stefanos S Sifandos (01:37.03) Quite simply as a disconnect from our own truth, there's a shame that binds us to not revealing more of ourselves. And that shame is really confronting and really scary. And we mask it and we overcompensate with outwardly projected success, with busyness, with overdoing, with essentially not being our true selves. We're in touch with the parts that need attention or need to be oriented towards. And that could be a deep sadness. That could be... fear of sorts or a combination of different things that are just very uncomfortable emotionally and relationally and psychologically. And I would go as far to say spiritually that we avoid and then we overcompensate with the greatness that appears we've created in our lives, which by the way carries merit, carries worth and value. But the come from behind that, motivation or movement, the it's not inspiration, really, it'`,

    content: `We grew up taught to, you know, not show weakness, right? And just push through life. But what, what type of damage do think that creates over time? Right? Specifically, we're taught that when we're younger and now in our 40s, 50s, 60s, that almost all comes at once. Stefanos S Sifandos (02:59.198) It causes significant disconnect in intimacy and relationships. It causes us again to wear many different masks, not be ourselves, not trust other men, not trust other people. That is a byproduct of our conditioning, of cultural norms, maybe at the time familial norms to suppress, not show weakness. And look, there's a time and a place for resilience and toughness, mental, physical, et cetera. There's a time and a place to grind and have grit and apply. resilience and toughness to certain experiences that we have in our lives. And the problem is for most of us as men, that's the only gear we have. And because that's the only gear we have, we're lopsided in our expression, in our way of being. There's more to us than just that. We're multifaceted beings, human beings. There's many layers to us. And we don't have mastery over that inner world, that emotional layer, that psychological, that spiritual, that relational layer. We feel very empty. Foundationally, every single one of us as humans wants to be seen, wants to be accepted, respected, wants to be loved. We want to reciprocate that. We want to be understood. We want to be heard. We want to be appreciated for who we are. We want to add value to the people that matter to us in our lives. And if we do that from a superficial place, it won't feel meaningful. There will be no substance there. And so we have to keep compensating. And we're just not being ourselves. Funk Roberts (04:22.702) You keep saying we're not being ourselves. A lot of times we find, I find anyway, sometimes I'm just disconnected from who I really am, right? Because I'm so many other things throughout life that I'm kind of like, who am I actually? you know what I mean? Cause I'm doing stuff for my kids and then my business and my wife and you know, everything else that goes around, but I don't really kind of connect with myself. What is, what is holding all of this back? Like suppressing our emotion and suppressing our vulnerability and kind of like pushing through, what is that doing to us? internally and externally, like with our health and everything else that goes on around us. Stefanos S Sifandos (04:57.414) Yeah, at a nervous system level, so many times as young people, as children, during our formative years, we experience intensity in our lives. And that intensity can come in the form of parental rupture, like our parents divorcing. It can come in the form of physical, sexual, and or emotional abuse. It can come in the form of bu`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.978) All right, guys, today we our guests are Kelsey Dunbar and Mark Rogala, co-founders of Suffer to Tougher. They're authors, their speakers, their coaches, and powerful advocates for resilience, mental fitness, and personal growth. What I love about their message is that it speaks directly to what so many men over 40, 50, and 60 are experiencing right now. We're carrying more responsibility than ever before. Whether it's careers or businesses, marriages, children, aging parents, financial pressure, health concerns. And somewhere along the way, many of us begin to believe that there's something wrong with us, you know, because we're feeling exhausted, we're overwhelmed, disconnected, and stuck. But what if the problem isn't that we're broken? What if we're overlooked? Today we're gonna unpack why so many men hit the wall after the age of 40 and how to build greater mental and emotional capacity. And what it really takes to become stronger, more resilient, and more capable in the second half of your life. Kelsey, Mark, welcome to the Men Over Forty Summit. How are you guys today? Kelsey Dunbar(Co-Founder) (01:02.264) Fantastic. Thanks for having us. Marc Rogala (Co-Founder) (01:04.254) Doing good. Thank you for having us. Funk Roberts (01:04.382) No problem. Okay. Great. Okay, so why don't we start with Kelsey? What what what what what is kind of what is this the you know suffer to tougher, right? What who people who are not who are not familiar with it, what is stuff suffer to tougher? Kelsey Dunbar(Co-Founder) (01:22.67) So Suver to Tougher is actually a name that Mark came up with a while back when he was posting during his recovery, and and I'm sure he'll talk more about that. But we decided to use that name to write a book, and the book actually evolved into a brand and a business that we feel very passionate about. Mark and I come from different coaching backgrounds. I've been in the fitness space for the last 30 years. Mark is more from the recovery world. And when we sat down and had a conversation one day, we realized that a lot of the same things that we use to coach the different people that we work with were actually quite the same. And that gave us the idea to put together a book talking about the different things that we advise people on in terms of all the things that you can do to get your mindset right and to recover from the tough days. And so we we did that book and We ended up doing a lot of public speaking engagements, a lot of book signings, and you know, we've both ig gone through plenty of adversity in our life, just different types of adversity and and I'm sure that'll come up. But it's it's interesting how much that we see things very very much the same way even though we have very different experiences.`,

    content: `what part of your personal journey most shaped the message that you guys are sharing today? Marc Rogala (Co-Founder) (02:59.346) Well, with me personally, I'm I'm in recovery. from from addiction. I'm an opiate addict in recovery and an alcoholic in recovery. what's interesting is the majority of my story happened over the age of forty, so I love the idea that you're having the summit. And I I got sober at forty five and I'm gonna be fifty two here in well I got sober about forty five and a half and I'm gonna be fifty two here in September. So it's been quite the journey. I mean from the outside looking in, I got married at a young age, started in the insurance industry at a young age, was the sole income provider of a family of six Four children. My wife was a stay-at-home mom. Was very successful in the insurance industry. But, you know, life was happening. You know, and you start talking about being overloaded. I felt like there was about 20 balls up in the air at the same time. Stayed away from alcohol for quite a while. Definitely was dealing with some anxious feelings and some anxiety. You know, really stemming back probably from when I was a teenager. And started, you know, frequenting the bars after work with my sales representatives because I had a team of 30 sales representatives. Former self medication, even though I didn't view it at that particular time. My diet was absolutely terrible. I mean, it reeked of depression. And quite frankly, I put on a lot of weight, developed a neck and back issue, had two conflicting test results. The surgeon didn't want to operate. He referred me to a pain management doctor not too far from where I lived. He introduced me to prescription pain pills, and once he introduced me to prescription pain pills, it took me down a path that really brought me To my knees. I lost that great job in the insurance industry, making really good money. my wife divorced me after twenty five years of marriage, lost my relationship with my children. I had multiple visits to treatment during a short amount of time, multiple overdoses during that period of time. Marc Rogala (Co-Founder) (04:56.818) You know, I was in a car accident and my head went through the windshield and then I woke up on a ventilator. And ultimately In July of twenty twenty, I was pretty much found dead. I was I was revived by first responders and I was sent to intensive care and I was told that my kidneys and liver had sustained some damage, but they had told me that if they were able to get the functions under control or at least stabilized or reverse it, then I would be going down to psychiatric care because they classified the overdose as a suicide attempt because of the amount of drugs and alcohol found in my system. And when I went down to the psychia`,

    content: `Nick (00:00.078) Hello everyone, my name is Jason Brown from Jason Brown Coaching.com. Today I'm gonna talk about five strategies for the 40 plus man that's gonna allow you to improve your training, improve your life, allow you to get better gains, all the things that we want as a 40 plus man. I am myself a 43-year-old dad of three, business owner, and have a lot of things on my plate. And a lot of the strategies that I'm gonna talk about today have been strategies that have been an integral part of my success of being able to improve my fitness in my 40s, not go backwards, go forward. And there's a number of things that we need to do. Today we're gonna talk. About five of those things, and again, these are things that I apply to myself, they're things I talk about on social media, and they really are the hallmark of a great training program and a great approach for the 40 plus man. So, we'll talk about those five things, and then we'll culminate this discussion by giving you actionable steps. What can you take from this information today and apply tomorrow to your own training, to your own lifestyle? These are things that you can integrate. right away and see an improvement. So I am super excited to give you guys this information today. And I'm really excited to potentially connect with some of you outside of this presentation and support you in the future because I think 40 plus men have a lot of unique challenges. And the best approach is often the approach that we think is too easy or maybe it's not as intense as what we did in our 20s. And think that's a misconception that we need to break down. So, to get right into things today, the first thing I want to discuss with you is a full body approach your training. Now A lot of times men think full body is going to negate a lot of the gains that they're looking for, like gaining lean tissue, potentially gaining strength. Whether or not you're even concerned with performance metrics like power and strength, they are an integral part in things that we are going to talk about in this presentation today. But a full body split has a number of advantages. Even if you are an advanced trainee, I use a full body split myself. I've been training my entire life. Nick (01:50.584) For the most part, seriously, 25 plus years. And this is a split that I have dug into more the last five. Five to six years. I've always been aware of full body training. It's something that I've experimented with, even in my 20s, but I didn't fully buy into the approach of full body training until my late 30s. And there's a number of reasons why. Now, the first piece that it's important to get out of the way is that the psychological aspect of doing full body training. Oftentimes people think it's only for beginners. And if I'm advanc`,

    content: `And it's a great split because it gives you a little bit more frequency where you can be exposed to those movements and build motor control. On the other end of the spectrum, people that are more advanced can get a lot of bang for the buck because number one, don't have to perform four, five, six sessions per week to get everything they need. It's great if you're on a budget as far as how much time you have available. I haven't met a whole lot of people after coaching for over 20 years that have a Surplus of time, especially For the dads out there, 40 plus ma'am, usually a surplus of time is a luxury. For those that surplus of time is just not there for them, full body training allows us to check all of the boxes with less overall sessions per week. Two to three strength sessions per week. You can get everything you need. You can check all your boxes, hitting your foundational movement patterns. Again, your squat, your hands, your lunge, your push, your pull, even loaded carry. There are some other things, nuances to that that we could potentially pepper in, like isolation work. The other end of it is that it'll give you more time to recover. You're not trashing your body with a lower split or a body. Nick (03:25.498) Part split, something that's more traditional to the hypertrophy world, if you will, where they're systematically just crushing one aspect of their body. Those are hard to recover from. And there's a number of reasons why. We're gonna talk about some of the potential reasons that recovery could be lacking for you. But know that this split is a lot easier to recover from a full body split. Gives you everything you need and less overall session. So that's a great advantage. Now, the other advantage is that because we don't have to perform four, five, six sessions per week to hit all of our strength work, we have more room for other. Other things. Those other things I have argued and will continue to argue are more important than the strength training itself. And we're gonna talk about that. It's gonna be our next point. But to take away the most important part of full body training for you, the end user, is that we can check all of our boxes in less sessions per week. We don't have to train with a crazy amount of volume. We can spread that out across the week. Now, for those of you that have a higher training age, this split works to your advantage because you know yourself, you know how to push. Those of you that are watching right now, you probably know you're all of your max numbers you probably know what your max deadlift max bench all of those metrics and again even if those are not important to you you're probably someone that knows yourself knows your body knows how to push so when I say do a movement and have two reps in the tank `,

We are excited to be joined here by by a real legend in this space, Joe DeFranco. So Joe, thank you again, man, for for being here and and pouring into the community. Thanks for having me. I'm excited to talk shop. Absolutely. So let's let's do it. Let's dive in. And so we we set this up of of where we want this conversation to be. Obviously there's gonna be a lot of things represented in this event for For training, for training methodology. But really the most important thing for for men in this demographic is training that serves the long game, training that's sustainable, training that serves your longevity is something that you're actually able to continue to show up for and actually able to to do. And I know you have really great, great set of of principles here for this, some some commandments to to operate for. And so what we're gonna do is we're gonna We're gonna work through these and and talk through each of these a little bit more. So I'll let you I'll let you kick us off with the first the first commandment, if you will. All right, yeah. So over the years, you know, I'm I'm about to turn 51. I started training at 11, pretty seriously too with my dad. so it's it's almost 40 years of lifting, and you learn a thing or two, right? When when you're in the gym. the things I did when I was 11. versus 22 versus 30 versus now 50, they change. You know, a lot of things stay the same. There are some basic principles that we follow. But as I got older and my body started feeling more like 50 than than 20, at the age of 30, I must say, you start realizing you need to do some things a little bit different. You have to train smarter. this whole like social media No days off, hashtag beast mode. It all sounds great until you actually turn 50 and you realize I want to continue training. Man, if I'm around for another 50 years, hopefully, I I want to keep training until the day I die. So this isn't like an every now and then thing. I I really look at it through the lens of like a lifelong endeavor and Nick (02:25.996) With that being said, I I preface my my laws with all that because my very first training longevity law is if it hurts, don't do it. And that's like counterintuitive to the no pain, no gain, you know, crowd and and everything we see on social media. And it's not, I'm not talking about, you know, if if you if you're in a tough set and and you're burning and you want to quit. Not that kind of hurt. I'm talking about injury, physical pain, the bad kind of hurt that you see all the time. Monday at your commercial gym, somebody lays down on the bench, they do that first set, they grab their shoulder, you kno`,

    content: `And then you just repeat that process until you do real da real damage to your shoulder and you need shoulder surgery, or you know, you you end up going to physical therapy and now you're on the shelf for six months anyway, rehabbing that shoulder. So very important to know the difference between discomfort from training and that's that's not a good pain. I need to do one of two things. Move for the time being. Do something else. Now I'm not saying if your shoulder hurts when you bench, just ignore it and don't bench. Let's figure out why my shoulder hurt when I bench. But in the meantime, while we're figuring that out and hopefully doing taking the necessary steps to repair that, do something else in the meantime. And there are that I that kind of just I'll quickly segment into number two because they go hand in hand. My second law, Which is there are no mandatory exercises. So whether you if unless you are a competitive power lifter or an Olympic weightlifter and you specifically have lifts that are your sport, there's no reason to force an exercise that does not feel right for your body type or a a previous injury you may have had, as long as you're kind of covering the main foundational movement. Nick (04:52.302) Patterns, an upper body push, upper body pull, squat, hinge, lunge, and and some kind of a carry. There's we could we could do we could talk for hours, for days, for weeks, going over all the different push exercises we like, pull exercises, squat variations, hinge variations. The specific exercise doesn't matter. Choose one that is an appropriate fit. For your body type, your anthropometry. We all have different limb lengths and and structures. So pick an exercise that quote unquote fits your body properly. So you could then execute it with precision and then overload it over time without doing more damage, as opposed to saying, Well, everyone's straight bar benches on Monday. So that's what I'm gonna do. And Everybody straight bar deadlifts from the floor. So even though I have little T Rex arms and I look like the letter C when I'm setting up for that deadlift, I'm gonna do it anyway because that's what everyone else does. So th those are my first two laws. I don't know if you want to keep going, cause obviously you could see I could talk forever, but I will I'll hand it back over to you. Yeah, no man, it's it's it's good stuff because I I think you we often see like you have two kind of schools of thought with something that doesn't feel right or something that's painful. Obviously, like you said at the top, you have the the certain mentality of just like, you know what, whatever I feel, like I'm here to just push through no matter what, which is, as you alluded to, not the the right strategy. Then I think you have this other side of`,

When when you're in the gym. the things I did when I was 11. versus 22 versus 30 versus now 50, they change. You know, a lot of things stay the same. There are some basic principles that we follow. But as I got older and my body started feeling more like 50 than than 20, at the age of 30, I must say, you start realizing you need to do some things a little bit different. You have to train smarter. this whole like social media No days off, hashtag beast mode. It all sounds great until you actually turn 50 and you realize I want to continue training. Man, if I'm around for another 50 years, hopefully, I I want to keep training until the day I die. So this isn't like an every now and then thing. I I really look at it through the lens of like a lifelong endeavor and Nick (02:25.996) With that being said, I I preface my my laws with all that because my very first training longevity law is if it hurts, don't do it. And that's like counterintuitive to the no pain, no gain, you know, crowd and and everything we see on social media. And it's not, I'm not talking about, you know, if if you if you're in a tough set and and you're burning and you want to quit. Not that kind of hurt. I'm talking about injury, physical pain, the bad kind of hurt that you see all the time. Monday at your commercial gym, somebody lays down on the bench, they do that first set, they grab their shoulder, you kno`,

    content: `And then you just repeat that process until you do real da real damage to your shoulder and you need shoulder surgery, or you know, you you end up going to physical therapy and now you're on the shelf for six months anyway, rehabbing that shoulder. So very important to know the difference between discomfort from training and that's that's not a good pain. I need to do one of two things. Move for the time being. Do something else. Now I'm not saying if your shoulder hurts when you bench, just ignore it and don't bench. Let's figure out why my shoulder hurt when I bench. But in the meantime, while we're figuring that out and hopefully doing taking the necessary steps to repair that, do something else in the meantime. And there are that I that kind of just I'll quickly segment into number two because they go hand in hand. My second law, Which is there are no mandatory exercises. So whether you if unless you are a competitive power lifter or an Olympic weightlifter and you specifically have lifts that are your sport, there's no reason to force an exercise that does not feel right for your body type or a a previous injury you may have had, as long as you're kind of covering the main foundational movement. Nick (04:52.302) Patterns, an upper body push, upper body pull, squat, hinge, lunge, and and some kind of a carry. There's we could we could do we could talk for hours, for days, for weeks, going over all the different push exercises we like, pull exercises, squat variations, hinge variations. The specific exercise doesn't matter. Choose one that is an appropriate fit. For your body type, your anthropometry. We all have different limb lengths and and structures. So pick an exercise that quote unquote fits your body properly. So you could then execute it with precision and then overload it over time without doing more damage, as opposed to saying, Well, everyone's straight bar benches on Monday. So that's what I'm gonna do. And Everybody straight bar deadlifts from the floor. So even though I have little T Rex arms and I look like the letter C when I'm setting up for that deadlift, I'm gonna do it anyway because that's what everyone else does. So th those are my first two laws. I don't know if you want to keep going, cause obviously you could see I could talk forever, but I will I'll hand it back over to you. Yeah, no man, it's it's it's good stuff because I I think you we often see like you have two kind of schools of thought with something that doesn't feel right or something that's painful. Obviously, like you said at the top, you have the the certain mentality of just like, you know what, whatever I feel, like I'm here to just push through no matter what, which is, as you alluded to, not the the right strategy. Then I think you have this other side of`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.564) All right, guys, welcome to today's summit talk. Today we're diving into one of the most overlooked areas of men's health over 40, and that's gut health. Because we gotta be honest, right? Like a lot of men are dealing with bloating, low energy, stubborn belly fat, inflammation, brain fog, poor digestion, cravings, hormone issues, and bad sleep, and they think it's just part of aging. But today's guest is here to tell us that many of these symptoms may actually be started from the gut. And I'm joined by a good friend and expert Joyce Somers, a holistic gut health practitioner, a transformation coach, a wellness educator, and a good friend, of course, who's helped thousands of people restore their health, improve digestion, rebalance hormones, and transform their bodies from the inside out. Joyce, also the creator of the Healthy Gut Transformation Program, and has spent over a decade helping busy professionals improve health, reduce inflammation, and of course get into the best shape of their lives. Through nutrition, lifestyle, gut repair, and functional wellness strategies. And what I love about Joy's approach is that she doesn't just focus on symptoms, she actually looks at the root causes. And today we're gonna talk about we're gonna talk about gut health for men over forty and how healing your gut may actually complete transform the way you look, the way you perform, and your overall health. Joy, thank you and welcome to the Men Over Forty Summit. How are you today? Joy (01:20.98) So good to finally be doing this. I'm so excited for this. This is what an epic week you have ahead. Funk Roberts (01:28.024) Yeah, for sure. And thank you for being part of it. Okay, let's get started with kind of like why gut health is a massive issue for men over forty. I know you have a presentation, so let me know if you want to go d directly to the presentation or kind of start off with that. Sure. Joy (01:38.486) Yeah let's get into that because I think that it's gonna explain a lot of questions and then we can kinda go on tangents after that. So let's just buy quick how do I move this screen? Let's see here. There went too far. My s my computer's a little slow. Okay. Funk Roberts (01:50.606) Perfect. Yeah, no problem. Joy (02:00.044) Boom. All right, there we go. We're back. Okay. So, yeah, like you said, I have been in this field for a long time. Now, you and I met back in Thailand, like I don't even know how long ago. It's probably been eight to ten years. but I I initially got into help. My mom was a homeopathic doctor, an herbologist. She we, I mean, we were raised on herbs and oils. And so having that as an upbringing. Funk Roberts (02:02.574) Yeah. Funk Roberts (02:24.832) Yeah. Joy (02:26.25) Then getting into my own CrossFit powe`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (02:33.678) Yeah. Joy (02:47.338) And so as soon as I figured out how to go from like sweet tooth joy into this more like holistic health lifestyle joy, everything changed. and this is my passion with teaching people what what it is that makes gut health so important and how they can do the simple basic things to improve their overall health. So this is a disclaimer, I'm not a doctor, but I do love. Funk Roberts (02:53.846) I think more than Funk Roberts (03:13.326) Why do you not do Joy (03:14.454) taking clients through transformations. because it's like a lot of the things that we talk about are the things that doctors don't have time to explain during during a hospital visit, you know? So getting right into it. Gut health is so important because it produces the majority of our serotonin and our dopamine. So, you know, I had a client reach out to me today and he said, he said, Joy, what peptides can I get on to improve my mood? And I said, Well, when's the last time you got your blood work done? When have you looked at your hormones? When have you, you know, when was the last time that you just did like a sugar detox? Funk Roberts (03:31.028) Funk Roberts (03:43.458) Thanks for Joy (03:57.12) Because all of these things play a role in your gut health, right? So all the hormones were produced. So it's it's all starting right here. So understanding the connection, that that mind-brain connection and that your gut really is your first brain, this is really important. I mean, I'm sure you've heard about leaky gut, right? Do you I mean I so many people have leaky gut skills. Funk Roberts (03:59.106) Sleep. Funk Roberts (04:18.112) yeah. Joy (04:21.792) Yeah. So leaky gut, the way that I like to describe it is that it is like soldiers that are there protecting your gut lining. And if these soldiers like get knocked down. Then all the pathogens and like the bad bacteria, they start seeping into our gut. And this is what causes chronic inflammation. And at the root of most diseases is chronic inflammation. I mean, we're talking about like Alzheimer's, is now the type 3 diabetes, and Alzheimer's is just chronically inflamed brain cells. So what we're trying to look at is to lower the amount of inflammation, lower the amount of toxicity. I mean, we're looking at we're gonna get into this in the presentation, but like heavy metals, microplastics, mold, all of these things. and so I put this funny picture here just because like my mother, my grandmother, my great-grandmother's generations, they weren't suffering and struggling the way that people are now. You know, like look at back at these pictures, like how fit everybody was. And now you go to a beach and it's like a totally different story. So right. Like Yeah. Go ahead. Funk Roberts (05:33.9`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.652) What is going on brothers and guys today we've got, we're diving into a topic that every man over 40 needs to hear because aging really starts to show up, not just how you look, but obviously how you move and how you feel. Because one of the first things that men lose is not strength. It's mostly power, explosiveness and athleticism. And that's why so many men wake up feeling slow. They feel stiff, they feel fragile, they feel beat up and constantly dealing with aches and pains. But today's guest is here to change that. I'm joined by Dr. Justin Farnsworth, a doctor of physical therapy, board certified sports clinical specialist, performance coach, and the founder of Rebuilt and Programming Around Pain. Justin spent over two decades in the world of high performance fitness, rehab, athleticism, as a coach, clinician, and athlete himself. He's taught over a hundred certification courses and has become one of the world's leading voices helping bridge the gap between rehab and real world performance. And what I like and respect about Justin is his philosophy that good rehab and good training should actually be the same thing. He teaches people how to move better, how to train better, how to reduce pain and real athleticism without destroying your joints or feeling broken all the time. So today we're going to talk about what it really means to become an athlete over 40, how to rebuild power, train explosively, safely, protect your joints and keep moving like a strong, capable athlete for decades to come. Justin. Nice to meet you and welcome to the Metaverse 40 Summit. Justin Farnsworth (01:30.004) What's up man, thanks so much for having me. I love that intro, that's awesome. What does it mean to be an athlete over 40? Funk Roberts (01:32.194) Yeah, man. Yes, let's talk about that. So first though, what is actually happening to the body, the guy's body in the 40s, 50s, 60s that causes them to feel stiff and fragile? Justin Farnsworth (01:46.715) I'll tell you, I think what happens in your 30s, 40s, and 50s starts when you're in your 20s, right? Because I ask this all the time. Like I go and I teach courses, I teach coaches, and I'm like, hey, how many of you played sports growing up? And I mean, literally everyone raises their hand, right? I'll be real. I think it's probably not changing. We know youth sports is growing. Everyone's playing sports. And I look at them like, OK, how many of you, what age did you stop playing sports? And everyone's like, after high school. If you're lucky after college, will be like, oh, you know when I was like 20? And I'm like, no, that's the wrong answer. The answer should be never. And it's not that I play like in the adult men's league basketball, but it's that I do athletic things so that when I `,

    content: `So are there age things that happen? Sure. Do we generally lose testosterone as we get older and hit our 40s? Yes. Do we have general age related changes in power where it goes away faster than strength once we hit 40? Yeah. But can being athletic forever be a possibility and slow and dare I say reverse those changes? The answer is yes. So I think it's the mindset around like I don't need to be an athlete or athletic if I'm not playing sports. It's like, well, no, because at some point, like getting off the ground requires you to be athletic and have power. Picking up your kids requires that. Moving in many directions outside of the phone booth, that requires that. If you live in a big city like New York City and you got to get out of the way of a car, like that is kind of athleticism. So we tend to lose the big picture that athleticism only means playing the sport when really, let's be honest, the sport of life can be a sport. Funk Roberts (03:43.374) Yeah, definitely. mean, all of the movements that you do throughout the day, you know, or can, or like, you you're shuffling, you're running over here, you're doing these things. Those are a lot, a lot of those things are athletic movements, if not all of them in some way. But you mentioned something and I just want to push back a little bit because we do wake up at 40, 50, 60 saying, oh my God, like where's the stiffness come from? Like where, where'd all this thing come from? Right? Because, you know, for guys now, I want to know, like we want to know that, okay, well if, I used to play sports and I didn't have to play sports for 20 years. Can I still get that athleticism back? Right? Like, can I still get it back? Even though I feel broken. Justin Farnsworth (04:21.408) I think there's absolutely yes. In fact, I think a multi-directional movement not only makes you more athletic, we'll dive into what that actually means, right? But also it makes you not stiff. Like I just think about the normal client avatar, like the average Western society person, what are they doing every day? They are sitting in a chair at breakfast, they're sitting in their car. They're sitting in their home office. They're sitting in their work office. They're sitting back in their car and then they're freaking sitting at their kids soccer game, right? And then they say, hey, I'm 40 and I'm stiff. And yes, look at I'm 38. I get it. There are things at 38 that I simply am like, it takes me longer to recover from this bout of jumping than when I was 17. That's normal, right? But not being able to like get out of bed because you feel that's not normal. And I really truly think like something as simple as like a lateral lunge, right? Let's say we take that as an example. Is that athletic in the sense of I'm gonna go dunk a basketb`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:01.058) Hey guys, all right. So one of the biggest challenges facing men in their 40s today is the isn't lack of information. It's actually information overload. Every day we're bombarded with new supplements, new tests, new experts, new longevity hacks, and conflicting advice about what we should do in order to live longer and perform better. But here's the reality: many men get their blood work done. They receive a stack of lab reports and they still have no idea what to do next. Others spend thousands and thousands of dollars on supplements and advanced testings, yet continue to feel tired, overweight, inflamed, and frustrated. So today's guest believes that the problem isn't that men lack information, but the problem is the lack of integration. Keith Bozeman is the founder of Medgevity and is a passionate advocate for more proactive, physician-led approach to health and longevity. After navigating his own frustrating healthcare journey, Keith realized that. Most men don't need more data. They need a coordinated strategy and a trusted medical team to help them connect the dots. So today we're going to discuss how guys like you in your forties, fifties, sixties can become a better healthcare consumer and how to properly use all of those tests and blood work and why most longevity advice is driven more by marketing instead of medicine. Keith, welcome to the Men Over Forty Summit. How you doing today, brother? Keith Bozeman (01:20.939) I'm doing great. Thank you. Appreciate you having me. Excited. Funk Roberts (01:24.494) Absolutely. So why don't we just start with your journey? Because your journey into healthcare started as a patient, right? Not as actually a healthcare executive. So what frustrations did you experience that led you to medgevity? Keith Bozeman (01:31.19) Yes. Keith Bozeman (01:37.162) Well, interesting. it what the journey didn't start with frustration. It started with I had a great doctor and I had great health care. And and I just took for granted that everybody had this. So I had a doctor for twelve years, who understood nutrition, understood fitness, understood medicine. you know, we would spend time together where we'd you know, as a concierge doctor, so we had time. So we we got to know each other, but it'd be, you know, 20, 30 minutes on my labs and maybe another hour on everything else going on in my life, stress, work, marriage, fitness, nutrition. and he really understood it. he wrote me one prescription in 12 years. and you know, he was practicing lifestyle medicine before I think there was even a term for lifestyle medicine. So had a great doctor, then I moved. And about five years ago, four years ago, and I had to find a new doctor. And then that's when the frustration set in. again, I took for granted`,

    content: `And the last one, you know, it was kind of a tense meeting. you know, I he wasn't kind of meeting the needs I had. And and at this time, I was, you know, watching a lot of podcasts. I was really interested. I was reading, listening, and I really just tried to. As I'm going through this of what to read and listen to, I found out there's a difference between science and just information. So I started just really following doctors and scientists. And I forget I asked him a question about circadian rhythm for my metabolism. And he just threw up his arms. He's like, I don't pay attention to any of that stuff. I only focus on evidence based medicine. That's the first time I've ever heard that term, evidence based medicine. And I wasn't asking some crazy new supplement that's like it was just it was like it was a PhD scientist who was talking about it. And I remember walking out of that office just thinking, I wish there was one place I could go to to get all of my healthcare needs met. I always wanted an MD because even though my doctor only wrote me one prescription for an infection, I had the security blanket knowing if I ever did get sick and needed a doctor, I had a great one. So I wanted an MD if I needed it. But what I really wanted was if I'm sick one or two days a year, I wanted someone, the 363 other days. Keith Bozeman (03:58.397) Giving me strategies to keep from getting sick. So walked out of there just saying, I wish it was one place. At first, I was thinking build like a super center where you just walk in and everything's there. The gym's there, the doctor's there, the the imaging equipment's there, the testing equipment's there. And realized it would be difficult because you just can only, you know, service people within the 30 miles of that gym and decide to do something virtually. And that's what we've done is put together every Patient has a a medical team of a of a board certified physician, an exercise physiologist, and a registered dietitian, medical nutrition and fitness strategies. Funk Roberts (04:37.346) Wow, that's that's incredible. Yeah, man, I feel your pain. And most guys listening right now can probably say that they feel their pain. I know that when I do my coaching calls and I talk to the guys and they're telling me, you know, my doctor told me this or my doctor told me that based on, you know, the 10 minutes or 15 minutes that they were able to spend with me, that they get they do get frustrated. They do get frustrated with not getting, you know, whatever they need, right? Or or or the right information, or maybe just that's the information they get and they they go with and then I'm talking to them and Tell them something totally different. It's like, well, right?

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.97) All right, guys, today I'm excited because I'm saying that with someone I truly respect. This is my brother, my man Lance Short. Lance is 65 years old, and he's the definition of a man who refuses to stay sidelined. Born and raised in New York City, Lance has lived a life built on movement, discipline, and constant evolution from the dance floors in his early years to serving as a military officer, earning his black belt in karate, and later becoming a certified instructor and advanced salsa dancer. But what makes Lance's story more powerful is not what he's done, but what he's become. Because he's pushed through multiple surgeries, including fused ankle. And at 58 years old, after an open heart surgery, that most people would slow down, Lance did the total opposite. He stepped onto the mats and became a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. And today he's still training, still competing, and still leveling up. And that's why I love Lance so much. I love his mindset. So today we're going to talk about resilience. We're going to talk about longevity. LANCE SHORT (00:45.716) You Funk Roberts (01:00.366) And we're going to talk about why men in their 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond need to keep showing up, keep moving and keep fighting, especially on the jujitsu mats. Lance, thanks so much for being here, my brother. This is going to be awesome. LANCE SHORT (01:10.208) Thank you. I need to have you follow me around and just say that to me in my ear now and then Keep me going that that's awesome. That's awesome. That's awesome. I love you too brother. You know that Funk Roberts (01:18.301) I love you so much man and this is gonna be an incredible for sure. So let's start with this. Listen, Lance you're 65 years old and you're still training, you're still competing and you're still moving at a high level. What drives you? Like what drives you not to stay sidelined? LANCE SHORT (01:33.77) Well, a couple of things. One, I heard a long time ago what seems like a very silly statement, or maybe not so silly, like movement is life. Movement is life. Everything, there may be people who argue with me, but everything in the world that's alive moves in some kind of way. And so that means that the opposite is also true. You stop moving, it's over. So I didn't want to do that. mean, you know, I've got a teenager, get ready to go to university. And throughout his life, I wanted to be that dad that was able to do whatever he wanted to do. If he was like, hey, let's go throw a frisbee. All right, I'm down. Let's play football. I'm down. Let's race. I'm down. Let's climb a mountain. I'm down. I wanted to be there, be able to show up and to do that. becoming a dad later in life. Like I'm 65, he's 18. So that kind of tells you how that happened. My wife is 12 `,

Because, know, 65 years old, he's 18, a lot of us thinking at 65, am I even able to be able to be around, you know I mean? With my kid at 65. LANCE SHORT (03:04.859) No, there was definitely some, I don't know what the word for it is, but yeah. I don't know if scared is the word, but I knew I had to do something. I knew I had to do something. And they tell you, you're the average of the five people you hang around with most, and you're of my five. So I can look over and I say, well, Mark may not be as old as me, but he looks damn good. So. Funk Roberts (03:13.845) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. LANCE SHORT (03:32.799) You know, because I've done all your programs and all the rest of that. So I was like, at least there's a roadmap. There's a blueprint. So I think I can do it. think if Mark says I can do it, I can do it. So between the motivation of wanting to be there for my son and knowing that there was a map that I could use to help me do it, I just went for it, man. Just went for it. Funk Roberts (03:48.238) Thank Funk Roberts (03:53.07) Right. All right. So you've had multiple surgeries. In fact, I think one of the surgeries you had, I think we were in the hospital at the same time. I don't know if it the open heart, right? But okay, so let's talk about that because you you've had multiple surgeries. I remember when you had the ankle infusion and because we were talking about like, you asked me things, okay, biomechanically, if I'm not able to do this or this, how am I going to, you know, what, how do I walk or do this exercise? And then also open heart. like, LANCE SHORT (04:00.744) Right, Yeah, I it was the open heart. Funk Roberts (04:22.38) What's the mindset during both of these times, starting with the ankle, think was first, and then the open heart? LANCE SHORT (04:26.75) Well, here's the thing. So, let's use salsa dancing for a minute. again, I started dancing because my wife started dancing, so, you know, I've seen the Rico Suave guys out there, like, I didn't want her doing it, and I couldn't do it. And I don't do anything halfway. So, I got into it. And from my early sports days, my ankle got really messed up, and so I would twist it constantly. Funk Roberts (04:37.74) Thank Yeah. LANCE SHORT (04:52.538) And so I would pop, before we went out dancing, we were dancing several times a week, I would be popping Advil and I'd be able to dance, but by the time I came home, I was literally, Mark, crawling up the stairs on my hands and knees. And I was like, okay, I can't do this. This is not sustainable for the long term. So I`,

    content: `Nick (00:00.182) Men Over 40 Virtual Fitness Summit. What's up, everybody? My name is Robert Linkel. I am the director of education over at Fitbody Bootcamp and the owner of TOA, TrainingTheOlderAdult.com. And I'm here today to talk to you about five resistance training strategies for men over the age of 40. We have all kinds of big stuff we're gonna get into here. But really, what I want to address and what I want you to come away from this presentation with is some strategies to help you as As you work your way through 40s towards 50 and beyond some good practices that you can do to help your body get strong, stay strong, and avoid injuries at all cost and maintain that strength and capability, even if you experience some limitations along the way. so we're gonna dive in. We got I got all kinds of stuff to share with you here over the next 60 minutes, but I appreciate you being here and sharing some time with me. And I do. Hope to give you as much value as possible. I am a proud dad. I have two daughters. These pictures are a little old, but they're awesome. My oldest, Peyton at the top, she is 12. My youngest, Bristol, is eight. And that is my awesome wife, Keegan. She is co owner of Training the Older Adult with me. I do all the in front of camera and programming and all that kind of stuff. And she does all of our back of house, the website and social media and our newsletters and all that good stuff. We're a great team. And she and I met back in the day when I was a brand new young threat. Coach and she was a finishing athlete throwing the javelin and becoming a regional champion. And the next year we started a date, and then a year and a half later we were married. And then our little ones came along. I have a master's degree in personal training from the United States Sports Academy and bachelor's degree in kinesiology from CSU Sacramento. And been working with the NSCA for 15 plus years. I just got done serving on their board of directors not too long ago, but I am I am a former NCAA hammer thrower. I threw for Reebok and pursued the 2008 Olympic Games. Here I am throwing the hammer. 212 feet. I needed like another nine inches, eight or nine inches on that throw to qualify for the Olympic training trials, and I just missed it due to some injuries. I ended up rupturing a disc in my back a little bit later on in this year, and that kind of ended my my throwing career over the next. Nick (02:29.816) Few years had a lot of other health issues that came about, including lung cancer, thyroid cancer, hip replacements, one that dislocated, hernia repairs, all kinds of good stuff. probably the hardest one being my hip replacements, or as you can see in the top right corner there, I will zoom in so you can get a better look of that. the removal of two `,

    content: `but a few years later in twenty sixteen at thirty-six years old, had arthroscopies and then had both of my hips replaced. twenty-four hours later, as you can see, my left one there dislocated. and I had to spend the night in the hospital and pretty tremendous. event in there. There was a gang shooting and a psych ward and all kinds of crazy stuff that went on. But the next day got my hip, had a full revision. And since then I've had a a wrist repair, carpal tunnel, and a tendon, and ligament, and a cyst removal, and all kinds of stuff, and a hernia, and I've got a Buford complex on my shoulder, all of this stuff. Not to impress you, but I'll steal a Tony Robbins line to impress upon you that life happens for us and not to us. It is a mentality my wife and I have where we get to look at everything a little bit on the on the bright side, if you will, of like, okay, what do we gain out of this experience? Will we gain gain knowledge and opportunity to see what it's like to go through something like this that most don't? Well, at 36 years old to go through multiple surgeries and hip replacements and back surgery and everything else, that's kind of your average 70 plus year old. And thus I was able to find, you know, I knew at 24 I was going to be. Nick (04:36.44) working with older populations, but 12 years in, you know, was really able to see like this is what it's like for my older adult clients and had a very unique experience to be able to do that. So enough about me. I'm ready to dive in here with all of you. You are welcome to head over to my YouTube channel and just punch my name in there, Robert Linkel, and you'll see all of our videos. I've got tons of stuff on there. I don't know, 400 plus videos on there now. we don't have a paywall, so just hop over and check it out. We talk a lot about resistance training and aging properly, but I have a lot of information on there about rucking as well, loaded walking, and we will be covering that quite a bit today. This is the agenda that we're gonna go through and the five strategies. Number one, we'll be kind of recognizing the problem, what we have. But basically just knowing that you're losing muscle mass. That's a big one. Then it'll be resistance training. What exactly can we do? I'm going to give you some like key focus lifts, show you a couple videos. Program design is very important from there. So we'll talk about that, how often you should be training, et cetera. Recovery, what kind of recovery strategies are there to help your body maintain good health? And we're going to talk specifically about your feet. Fellas, if you're happening to look down and seeing your feet and they look quite gnarly, I am going to give you my Personal healthcare routine of how I take care of my feet. I take great prid`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.467) All right, guys, today we're diving into a topic that becomes more important with every decade of life, and that is training like an athlete, right? Not just strength, not just muscle, but an athlete, the ability to move explosively, the ability to react quickly, stay athletic, and keep your body performing at a high level as you age. Because here's the truth, when men reach the age of 40, they stop training for power and athleticism, right? You stop sprinting, you stop jumping, you stop moving athletically. And over time, You slowly lose the very things that keep you capable, resilient, and youthful for life. So today we are going to change that. I'm excited because I'm joined by Luka Hosafar, a world renowned strength and conditioning coach, former professional basketball player, educator, and founder of Vigor Ground Fitness and Performance in Seattle and in Slovenia. Luka's coached thousands of clients ranging from everyday people to elite athletes in the NBA, the NFL, UFC, MLB. helping them move, perform and feel better at every single level. And what I respect the most about Luca is he understands how to bridge the gap between elite athletic performance and real world longevity for every person on planet. So today we're gonna talk about how to become athletic in your 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and the need to stop training like a fragile old man and start reclaiming your explosive movement, your patterns, so you can be strong, capable and injury free in your 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond. Luca, thank you so much for being here, my brother. Luka Hocevar (01:29.294) My pleasure to be on the show, man. For anybody that's watching, you just know, like, I'm looking at the screen, but I'm really looking at you guys. For me to look at you, funk, that's what it looks like. But yeah, I'm really passionate about this topic. I mean, I think it kind of came from once I was done, you know, playing pro sports, I was very much so, I hated not feeling athletic, you know, and what I mean by that is like. to me and a lot of the clients that come to us, and I'm sure you probably hear this a lot, somebody looks great, meaning they're shredded, but their tight hips, back hurts, they can't run with their son or daughter, they can't do anything functional. Functional could be like, hey, go play hoop, go for an eight mile hike, go pick up some heavy groceries, help a friend carry their couch, stuff, right? Those people are not like really satisfied. Like, you know, I look great, but I feel like shit. You know, like I can't perform and I feel like crap. Most of the time it's like you want to, you know, I call it look, feel and perform like an athlete without nagging, aches and pains. Right. And that will look different for different people. Now, what's funny`,

    content: `And I think there's, and I take sprinting because sprinting I think is one of the kind of, you know, expressions of athleticism that we can all think of. It has the highest forces and the highest, you know, fastest ground contact times and all that good stuff. And I think many people also think like, well, that's not for me. That's dangerous. Funk Roberts (02:56.083) All right. Luka Hocevar (03:22.926) And the truth is, it becomes dangerous at a certain point in time if you stop doing it. And then all of a sudden, you haven't done it since you're 26. You're 45. By the way, how many times have you seen this happen on social media to go viral? And then you're 45, 46. Your kid or your nephew is like, all right, unk. I'll out sprint you. And you're like, man, you're not going to out sprint me? And you go for a sprint, and boom, you You literally pop your hand me off the bone, you know, like, or you tear a calf and it killed like something bad. And of course, then you go like, see, this is not for me. I think a lot of people treat not just sprinting, but athleticism that way. Jumping, throwing, change of direction, decelerating, start, stop all that good stuff, right? Because they just never prepared their bodies to be able to do that. And everybody's heard, you know, use it or lose it. Funk Roberts (04:16.595) We can jump. Luka Hocevar (04:21.006) And the thing is, that is very true, it's like, use it lose it, there is a system of how to build up to doing these things. And before we turned record on, I was telling a little story about, like little yesterday, yesterday I'm at the gym, two ladies have been with us for a long time, they're like late 50s, 60s, retired, and one of them went to Sedona and one of them went to Hawaii. One went with their daughters for Mother's Day, one went on a vacation, and did this crazy hike. And same thing in Sedona, same thing in Hawaii. And they're like, it's so crazy to see people of our ages and how we were so stand out. We could just do stuff. We're barely out of breath. And everybody's like, what the hell is going on with you? How are you doing this? But guess what? There's strength training. They're jumping, they're throwing stuff, they're sprinting. We're regressing these movements based on their fitness level and where they start and whatnot. But it's just the kind like, I hear these stories every week, every month, and it's so fulfilling because I train Super Bowl champions and UFC fighters and Cy Young award winners. And it's like, that's awesome. But then when you see everyday people that are doing stuff that quote unquote, they shouldn't be doing, man, it's so good. And what they said, I think is a true thing for what every man wants. I think as they age, they were like, man, we're getting so much more out of l`,

Mark, thank you so much for being here, man, and being a part. My man, Nick Lamb, appreciate you, brother, for having me. I'm honored. I'm looking forward to this. You know, I'm very excited all the time to be able to have a conversation with you and to discuss, you know, important issues. So this is this is great. Absolutely. So let's let's get right into it. Let's let's dive in here. This is This is distinctly gonna be a bit of a different a different session here positioned within the the summit. You guys are gonna get so much information, so many training ideologies, nutrition strategies, supplementation strategies, hormonal strategies, all these, all these great moving, moving pieces. But at the end of the day, far and away, the most important piece is your own your own mindset, your own perspective, your own own approach. And where we're gonna dive in here and where Mark does an incredible job speaking and and leadership and otherwise is he's got a background as a as a retired Marine. He kind of really embodies and lives these elements of of self-ownership, of leadership, self-leadership. Because at the end of the day, the most important part to really everything you're gonna do this week is that you have to take ownership. No one's gonna do it for you. No one's gonna hand it to you. No one's gonna make it easy for you. And so, Mark, if you just speak to that kind of here initially in terms of this embracing ownership of your own, your own health, your own process, your own journey here. No, I love it, Nick. And yes, you're absolutely right. one of my one of my models, I have a few of them, but one of my models is is generational health and generational wealth. And also, you know, being able to change the trajectory of your lineage. I truly believe in that. a lot of people get stuck in a in a world where they're like, I I'm I'm stuck, I'm not gonna get any better than where I'm at today. And I think a lot of men over 40, they get into that world where they're saying, Well, you know what? I I'm already 40 something, 50 something, 60 something. What what are you gonna teach me? I'm I've learned enough. I I'm not gonna change. But what you don't understand and what the world doesn't understand is that those men that are over those ages, over 40. Nick (02:28.118) could really change the trajectory of their lineage. And what I mean by that is the the people that are following them. And I'm not talking about Instagram or social media. I'm talking about your children, your grandchildren, you know, even even the the other family members that are out there and watching you by your exam`,

    content: `And you see, and I challenge any one of the men that are on that watching this right now to ask either your children or people that are following you that are, you know, the next generation, what have they learned from you? What have they taken from you? You know, and believe it or not, one of the things that I've been told is my discipline, my structure, the way that I frame my life, you know, the way that I I exercise. the way I eat, the way I manage situations. And that all together encompasses leadership. And so I'm so passionate about being a a great leader that it just never stops. Leadership is continuous, but education about leadership is also continuous. It just never stops. Yeah. I love the the perspective of leadership as something more personal and in your own, like you said, your own lineage, your own life, your own situation. I mean, some Some of you guys obviously are leaders in a more traditional sense. Maybe you're CEO of a company, or maybe you you manage a team, maybe you're in that type of role professionally, and that's that's all well and good. But ultimately the leadership that matters is in your own in your own life. Leadership. Firstly, I I think obviously if you could speak to this too, like how you encourage And have men build their own self leadership, right? So that it becomes, okay, this is the leadership that I'm sharing with others and leading by example with, but what are the maybe the pillars or what are the kind of ways that you know, kind of look at look at that? Yeah, no, that's that's a it's a great question because I I do believe in the four pillars of of longevity of life, right? So you have your sleep, you have your stress, you have your exercise, and you have your nutrition. So I know it's probably gonna be spoken about Nick (04:52.77) numerous times throughout this whole summit, that these are the core pillars that you need to focus on. But I truly believe that with men, especially in, you know, getting into their 40s. So I'm 47, you know, so everybody knows, you know, 47 years old. I've got all my kids are in their 20s and I got grandkids. So, you know, two grandkids, I'm a grandpa. And I feel as if the the structure of my lifestyle The way that I handle my lifestyle is so important to leadership, not only for my kids and my grandkids, but also for the people that work for me. The fact that, you know, I am a CEO and I have people that look to me to see what I do. I compete, not just in not for you know, I guess vain purposes or like, look at me, look at me, look at the medal I got. It's more about I do a lot of competition and a lot of things. To show that I'm still getting out there. I can care less about being first place, to be honest with you. I mean, it's always nice, but at this point in my life, it's`,

    content: `Nick (00:00.802) Hey brother, welcome to my Tricon training presentation. So Not sure if you've heard of Tricon training or not. I'm going to explain why I created this, why it's so great for men over 40. It's a way to improve their joint health, it's a way to improve hypertrophy with minimal weights. And it's a phenomenal training protocol that you're gonna learn a lot about today. Alright, with that said, so tri-con stands for triple contraction. So triple contraction training, and I will explain it. exactly what that means as we go through this presentation. All right, so the first thing, let me move this over here. what you're gonna learn in this video, you're gonna learn what tricon training is, how I developed it, and why I developed tricon training, why it works. I'm gonna give you the scientific version of why it works along with the applicable portion, how you can apply it to your current training, and why it's ideal for men over 40. I've got guys in my program from 40 all the way up to their mid 80s doing tri-con training, so it's a phenomenal technique. and then there's different variations of tri-con. So, if you are familiar with my tri-con training, you've probably only heard of the Nick (01:14.689) The standard tricons. I also have a tricon X and a Tricon S. Tricon X is more for athlete-based, power-based training. Standard is the typical 9, 3, 3, and 3 that I will break down. And then the Tricon S stands for Tricon Stretch. So we'll go over those details here in a minute. Then I'm also towards the end of this, I'm going to show you 10 different demonstrations, different exercises. exercises, how to apply this to each exercise, and where to do the isometric holds and things like that. So it's gonna clarify a lot of things. I'm gonna give you a lot of information, then I'm gonna give you the visual videos breaking down the exercises, which is gonna bring it all home for you. Alright, so now why this matters? Again, I've been coaching, which we'll get into in a minute for a long time, but men over 40 specifically, I'm personally I'm 52. So I've gone through my 40s, currently into my 50s, and I've trained guys, 60s, 70s, and 80s, like I mentioned. So typically what happens is there's gonna be a natural loss of muscle, it's sarcopenia. So that's the medical term for it. Sarcopenia, and what I've got here that it begins at 40, actually begins in your 30s. It just depends on the individual. We're all a little unique. But in your 30s, there's a small gradual loss of muscle. Once you get into your 40s, that amplifies even more. So I'm going to explain why Tricon works the way that it does so successfully. Alright, and then also why it matters, older guys have more wear and tear on their joints. Just years of doing more things, whether it's dail`,

    content: `So your central nervous system doesn't speed up as far as recovery as fast as it used to in your 20s and even 30s. So you have to do everything to shift based on those scenarios. And then heavy alone lifting, so lifting heavy is something I don't typically recommend. But with that said, heavy is relative. When I say don't lift heavy, I'm gonna be explaining that. Nick (03:31.585) that heavy within the five rep max range or less, there's no need to ever do that, especially as an older guy. So what happens when you go that heavy, you are s overstimulating your central nervous system, but it's not just that, it's the the joints. The joints that can get degraded, the ligaments, the tendons, there's so much cartilage issues going on with degeneration. There's so many more issues that you're battling being an older guy, and when you just constantly apply heavy loads when it's not necessary, you're gonna create a lot of damage. Alright, and I'll explain how to load correctly here in a few minutes. So also just training smarter leads to long-term training. So you want to do this for the rest of your life. to add years to your life and then quality to those years you want to find a method that allows you to build muscle burn fat do those simultaneously while improving your range of motion improving your joint health and that's what tricon training does it does all of those things for you so it's a phenomenal method again so sarcopenia three to eight percent muscle loss per decade after 30 that's crazy to think about now who I am if you know who I am great I'm gonna share a few more details with you if you don't I've been I've got fifteen hundred videos on YouTube. Fifteen hundred videos on YouTube, millions of views. The main reason I want to put that out there is to let you know that I'm not a fly by night coach and I practice what I preach. I've educated you know thousands and thousands of men over the years through my videos or millions I've reached. Alright, I've been coaching for 30 years, been coaching for 30. I've been training personally since 1987. So 40 plus years of training and I I've also, like I said, coaching since nineteen ninety-two. I started at Texatech University in ninety-two, and the job I had when I started college was Nautilus Fitness Center as a personal trainer, and I've never looked back. I've been doing it ever since. I've competed in twelve NPC bodybuilding competitions. main thing with that is just challenging myself. I'm very competitive by nature. I've always wanted to push my body to the extremes and to the upper limits. I've done that through twelve bodybuilding shows from Nick (05:43.709) my 20 year olds body to 30s and two in my late 40s and so I'm probably not done yet but we'll see.

And that's nutrition and long-term health. And I'm joined by two absolute incredible experts who live and breathe this every single day. First, I've got Mike Ranfone, a high-performance strength and conditioning coach, entrepreneur and founder of Ranfone Training Systems. Mike has spent over 15 years working with everyone from everyday men to high level college and professional athletes, helping them improve their performance, body composition and longevity through science-based results driven approach. He started his career at Yale University working with over 500 division one athletes and has since built one of the most respected performance systems out there focused on discipline, behavior and mastering the fundamentals. And alongside him, we've got Dr. Marco Luchik. a physician, age management specialist, and co-founder of RTS Health. After training and working as a general surgeon, Marco has made the shift from treating disease to preventing it, helping men to control their health before problems even get started. He combines his medical background with athletic mindset, being a former Division I athlete himself, and now works as an intersection of medicine and performance, using advanced diagnostics, hormone optimization, and lifestyle strategies. to help men improve energy, lose fat, build muscle, and live longer, healthier lives. And what I love about both of these guys is they bridge the gap between real world training and real science. So today we're gonna break down what every man in their 40s, 50s, 60s needs to know about nutrition, what's working, what's not, and how to build a sustainable life. Guys, welcome to today's session. Marko P Lujic (01:43.246) Yeah, absolute pleasure. Thank you. Thanks for having us. Funk Roberts (01:46.574) Thank you for being Marko P Lujic (01:47.138) I mean, the nutrition topic these days seems to be quite the hot seat thing, right? And the interesting thing about it to me that I always like to get out there is we went through a lot of phases in nutrition in the world, like the whole Weight Watchers thing. Then it was the whole group fitness crossfit kind of took the scene by storm and took over with the exercise that then went with some nutrition to follow. But if you think about it, there has never in the history been a time where like dietary nutritional needs were paramount. And I mean there's a great musician that once asked the head corner stone, right? If we're look at the head corner stone of anything and you want to build a foundation around anything, you got to make sure that the base or the head corner ston`,

And I will then turn it over to really what Mike can hopefully deliver to you as why he thinks nutrition is a foundational aspect to our health. And then maybe we take it. from there in terms of categorization of kind of who we can help. Funk Roberts (03:21.516) Yeah, I think that that's great. And you hit on the head specifically with that, the changing of the type of diets, nutrition that are out there. But yeah, what are your thoughts on the importance of nutrition, Mike, specifically for these guys in their 40s, 50s and 60s? Marko P Lujic (03:37.769) I would say the number one thing is actually having a strategy that supports the goal. I think, you know, as Marco mentioned, there are a lot of these, you know, these flavor of the month style things. And, you know, again, I'm not saying that they don't work, but they're more tactical in nature than actual strategies. And I think that for the general consumer, they confuse something that works for the six week program and not for the six decades that you want it to really pay the dividends and have the life that you want. the body that you want and feel the way that you want. So that to me is really the probably the key point of figuring out how do we support from a nutritional perspective what you want to accomplish when you're in your 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond. Funk Roberts (04:22.99) Yeah, I like that too. So when guys are coming to you to talk about nutrition, I mean, I know for me, when guys come to me, they have no clue, but what are some of the mistakes that they're making? It's not really their fault, really, truly. mean, look at where we're at right now. We're the worst health we've ever been, pretty much across the board. So what are your thoughts on like, what are some of the mistakes that they're making or some of the things that they're coming in and struggling with when they're coming to you guys for nutrition in general? Marko P Lujic (04:31.834) Yeah. Marko P Lujic (04:48.704) Yeah, I want to I I want to like pause for one second and we're gonna get back to that problems With nutrition if you don't mind But I wanted to lead in with one thing because you you rang a bell in my head really loud About we're never taught Funk Roberts (04:57.837) Yes, please. Marko P Lujic (05:05.198) And it doesn't matter if a doctor learns nutrition. It doesn't matter if a nurse learns nutrition. It doesn't matter if an exercise specialist, doesn't actually matter if you learn `,

    content: `Nick (00:02.059) All right, what's up, guys? We are back here with another talk for the Men Over 40 Health Summit. And we are excited to be joined here by Molly Eastman. And Molly and I have been connected here for a while in the world of sleep, of sleep optimization. And we're excited to to have you here, Molly, and to to dive in. Appreciate you. Yes. Well, I appreciate you. Appreciate all the hard work you do to get out all of this information and various capacities. I know I've always seen you as this like you know, organizer of all of these incredible events, these incredible conferences. And so I'm always grateful to be a part of it. Absolutely. Absolutely. So so let's let's dive in here. And we obviously wanna wanna make this a tactical tactical sleep talk. on the the surface here, I find this to be interesting, especially for this this demographic Sleep is up there in the and positioned among the the pillars of health. However, in terms of the actual follow-through, and I find it especially for this demographic, it continues to be deprioritized. Although I think you and I would both agree that if there was one lever, and especially one that was low hanging fruit for them, and the one lever that has carryover to literally every facet of who they are, what they do, and what they're trying to accomplish. It would be sleep, but it's the one that tends to get put on the back burner. So firstly, let's let's start there, especially for what you found for men maybe in this demographic, why that why that is the case. Yeah, great question. I know it's been so unsexy, I think, this topic of sleep for a long time. It's sort of like the The throwaway, well, then of course, you know, prioritize great sleep, next, what supplements, what you know, other things can we do? And yeah, even just if we think of a kind of numbers game, like a pie chart of our lives, on average, we're spending a third of our lives sleeping. And on average, 26 years is spent asleep. So no matter what it is. Nick (02:18.698) it could behoove us to take a little bit of a look at this thing that we're spending just such an inordinate amount of time doing. And I think sometimes the things that we spend so much time doing it's like the law of familiarity, like we're just we're used to it, we don't think much about it, just kind of how it is. We're maybe resigned to it, or this is not much to look at. And yet if we re-audit our lives, anything that is taking up that much time Presumably is worth another look. and and it happens no matter what. So even for the worst, what we would categorize as the worst sleepers, those that have the worst sleep health, it's happening for them even to to some extent. It's it's happening no matter no matter what. And so again, like you said, it's this this de`,

    content: `and so since regardless, we're we're doing it every single night. and we can almost look at it too as a perspective of maybe there's something missing in the current paradigm that we're in, in that I think a lot of times things get missed. So when we think of our average doctors, if someone was listening to this and like, well, if I had a problem, I'm sure it would have been flagged somewhere along the journey and my, you know, in my health journey. and yet sadly, the average doctor has around two hours of training in even at a Harvard Med in this thing that we do so much of our lives. so even just systemically, not necessarily maliciously. just a lacking of education, then there might be many red flags that are just so obvious if someone is in this world that get wildly missed. So at the end of the day, I think right now it could even if we just tried on in this conversation, part of the reason I call my company Sleep is a skill is this idea that let's just say for now that sleep is this skill set that Nick (04:35.948) Because so few of us have learned much about it, let's just take on that. We're starting a kind of sleep 101 and what could be there to build upon and see could this make a big difference in our lives? Now, if you want to get into the you know research around it, you go to PubMed and put in sleep and just about anything that's important to you. Aging, longevity, you know, cognitive health. your even interpersonal skills, your ability to read facial cues. I mean, it is so like a spider of all of these impacts in our lives. so I think both just the black and white of it and then even the common sense of it, we can imagine that this is a very important and crucial area to take some time on. And I think even if you really think about it more in the I I've always said over the years, and it's a bit Maybe corny cliche, but I think it's so true is that sleep legitimately impacts how you show up and experience your life. Totally. And and so that's the part too that I think when we talk about sleep being a low-hanging fruit for you and for guys listening on their on their health journey, it it is this low-hanging fruit. And but I also get and I always understand that we're really not. Driven and motivated by the things that can happen 10, 15, 20, 30 years from now. It's just if that were the case, honestly, an event like this really wouldn't even need to exist. And we wouldn't need to create this set of information and inspire people to do the things that they need to do. And so while yes, we have the the long-term piece that we know sleep is correlated and sleep quality is correlated with literally every Chronic disease, every disease process, literally anything that you could imagine from a long-term perspective. I think the beauty is in the`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.795) All right, guys, today we're diving into a topic that impacts millions of men over the age of 40, 50 and 60, and that's chronic pain. That's inflammation. That's lack of movement. And why so many people feel broken down at this age, because let's get honest, know, a lot of men, a lot of us are living with back pain or knee pain, shoulder pain, chronic inflammation, stiffness, fatigue. And we've been told that it's just about getting older, right? that's supposed to happen when we get older. But today our guest is going to challenge that completely. I'm joined by Dr. Perry Nicholson and he's known as the Lymph Doctor, a chiropractic physician with nearly three decades of clinical experience, helping people overcome chronic pain and inflammation. Dr. Nicholson is a founder of Stop Chasing Pain and creator of the Big Six Lymphatic Mojo Reset, a powerful self-care system focused on improving the lymphatic's health movement, recovery and healing. But what I love about Perry so much is that he looks at the body differently, right? Instead of chasing the symptoms, he focuses on understanding how systems of how the systems of our body work together, movement, lymphatics, fascia, inflammation, nervous system, recovery, and how restoring those systems can completely change how someone feels and functions. And after overcoming his own severe back injury and autoimmune disease, he's dedicated his life to helping others. regain control of their bodies and their lives. And today we're going to talk about the five habits men over 40 need to stay strong or get strong, fit, resilient and hard to kill. Perry, thanks so much for being part of this summit. Thanks for being here. Perry (01:39.219) Thank you so much, my friend. I appreciate that. That was a really nice intro. Thank you. Great to be here. Funk Roberts (01:42.793) Great to have you. Okay, let's talk about what the biggest factor in chronic pain is for us guys in our 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond. Perry (01:53.602) Yeah, that's a great question. Well, one of it, quite frankly, is just a lack of general movement overall, right? We just, we just don't move a lot as a society anymore at all, at all ages. And then, so it's, it's a lack of movement, but here's what I also found is that doing the same type of movement all the time can also add to chronic pain. They don't add enough, what they call variation, variability, and variety. what I just call move more of yourself more often, more ways, more environments, especially I think men, because I'm 59. I grew up in the gym. started weightlifting and bodybuilding when I was 16, following Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know, the early 80s, the golden age of bodybuilding. And I think that that's still what's in our head is that You have to go to the g`,

    content: `If you've done some of the calisthenic routines or things that... Funk Roberts (03:09.629) You Perry (03:17.068) the military does. And you can be tanked in a matter of minutes just by using your own body weight. So one, I would say it's too much of sitting sedentary and then lack of variation and variability. Even just the very act of walking more can make a huge difference in your performance. Because I see injuries go up because people want to get in shape. Funk Roberts (03:38.099) Mmm. Yeah. Perry (03:46.903) want to get stronger and then they go from zero to a thousand miles an hour too quick and they go to the gym very often without guidance from a professional trainer or fitness person. They see stuff in a magazine that they saw or on YouTube. Go hard, go home, hashtag beast mode monster, pain is weak, just leaving the body kind of crap. And then the next thing you know, in a couple of days they're suffering from a chronic pain or a chronic injury that just doesn't go away. Funk Roberts (04:17.629) Yeah. You know, you mentioned something that, a lot of people overlook is like doing the same movement all the time. It's not even in the gym. It's like, I were, if I'm a construction worker or I have a job where I'm literally doing the same movement, maybe just with one arm every single day for 20 years, you know I mean? Or just like doing that same physical job, but you're only doing one thing. Yeah, definitely. That can lead to chronic pain, right? So you don't really think about, and also lead to more injuries when you reach 40. Cause it almost feels like when you're in your 40s or 50s, whatever, like all of a sudden you may get like a shoulder. It's like, oh man, you know, I just went to grab something and my shoulder, my shoulder just popped or whatever. Like I can't believe just grabbing that, but it's more than that, right? It's probably years and years of, of, of, that movement. You agree? Perry (05:05.934) Yeah, exactly right. That's what we call micro trauma. You you have like a major trauma of a slip, a fall, an accident, or you know, you get into a trauma, maybe like a fight or something, and then you hit your knee and you're like, oh yeah, I know why my knee hurts. But then micro trauma or stuff that you don't really pay attention to that happens slowly over time. It's like the water dripping down on the rock slowly over time. And the next thing, you know, all of sudden you got a hole in the rock. Funk Roberts (05:09.436) Okay. Funk Roberts (05:23.719) Mm. Perry (05:34.767) from the water slowly dripping in there. And that's the person who reaches for something in the cabinet, like you said, and then the shoulder goes, or a common one is, all I did was bend over to tie my shoe and then I couldn't get back up. You herniated the disc and`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:01.07) All right guys, today we're diving into something that almost every man over 40, 50 and 60 struggles with and that's pain. I know you've heard this before, but tight hips, bad backs, achy knees, stiff shoulders, neck tension. You know the crazy part is most men think it's just part of aging, but today's guest is here to tell you that a lot of the pain, stiffness and restriction men over 40 experience may not actually be because of age, it's because you've lost mobility, movement quality and connection with how your body is supposed to function. Today, I'm excited to be joined by very good friend, Rustin Webb, a mobility coach, educator, speaker, and founder of the Mobility Recipe, a movement system designed to help people reduce pain, improve mobility, and move better for life. Rustin specializes in helping men and women and trainers, well, men and women specifically, to overcome stiffness, joint pain, poor posture, and movement limitations caused by years of sitting, stress, repetitive movement, and aging. And through his mobility recipe methodology, Rustin teaches trainers and coaches and everyday people how to restore movement quality, increase flexibility, improve joint health, and build resilience using simple, effective mobility techniques that fit specifically into your life. And listen to this, his system is so powerful that it's the biggest fitness gym franchise in America is starting to implement it across their locations because it works, because it gets results. And what I respect the most about Rustin is that he's built a reputation for simplifying mobility and helping people understand what really causes the pain from tight hips and low back to shoulder problems, poor posture, stiffness, and movement dysfunction. And Ed, we've even actually partnered together to create the Alpha Mobility Program. Again, so you know that I respect all of the work that he's done. And today you're going to learn how to implement mobility Ruston Webb (01:48.618) Ha ha ha. Funk Roberts (01:57.472) into your life to fix pain, to move better and to feel younger. Rustin, my good friend, thank you so much for being part of the Men Over 40 Summit, brother. Welcome. Ruston Webb (02:06.834) Absolutely, thanks for having me. I'm glad to be here. Anytime, funk, anytime. Funk Roberts (02:10.634) Yeah. That's great. Let's start off with why do most men in their 40s, 50s, 60s feel stiff, feel tight and feel broken down? Ruston Webb (02:23.444) Yeah, absolutely. And I don't know where we're headed with all this, but don't let me forget to kind of go through the differences between flexibility and mobility because it's often used synonymously with people. And I want to make sure they know, I want everybody to the difference between those two. But y`,

    content: `And when I say modern fitness, we can go back as far back as, know, Gold's Gym. And when fitness started to become, you know, a bigger deal and more people are doing it. But it's something we've been kind of ignoring for long time. some industry, you know, some parts of the fitness industry have, you meddled in it a little bit, but it's becoming more and more of an issue. yeah, modern fitness. So here's what we see with modern fitness. If I ask just about anybody off the street, what's fitness? You're gonna hear hands down, everyone's gonna say strength, cardio, nutrition, right? Those are kind of these massive pillars and where you see the industry selling the most, whether it's a service, whether it's a pill and a supplement, whether it's some kind of nutrition program or the latest hit in cardio options out there. And then there's 8,000 different techniques to build strength. But those, would say, and you tell me, Funk, I mean, if you're gonna ask your average person, are they gonna go far outside of these three when it comes to what is fitness? And so, Funk Roberts (04:13.26) No, definitely not. Ruston Webb (04:18.71) The more I've studied this and I've been in the fitness industry for 25 years and I got my masters in kinesiology and through all the studying, I kind of started to notice this trend of strength, cardio, nutrition and Doug, and look, you can go deep into all three of these, but what I started to see was there was a missing tissue, a missing fiber that kind of held these all together. And I kind of want to explain why there's actually a fourth pillar. Hence why on the screen you're seeing this question mark on the far right but The easiest way to explain this is to kind of go go here. Okay funk you you've had kids Tons of the men over 40 have had kids if not, you've held a baby Or you were a baby yourself, right? So what we look at and how we kind of break this down and when you talk about mobility or you just talk about the human movement in general, is we always like to go all the way back to when we're first born. And what happens when a baby is being held and is brand new, you know, and you're passing that baby around? What do you always hear people say? hold its head, right? Hold its head. Right, because it's gonna flop all over the place. And what... Funk Roberts (05:36.771) Yeah. Ruston Webb (05:41.785) what nature is showing us just from a human movement standpoint, babies come out 100 % mobile. Like they are purely mobile. They could practically bounce, right? Their bones can actually bend. Their head is still malleable. Like we are dealing with pure mobility at its finest, right at birth. And we have to stop ignoring that and understand that this is the blueprint for human movement. Babies don't come out stiff or overstable`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:00.916) All right, guys. All right. Today, I'm really excited. We're going to dive into a topic that confuses a lot of men over the age of 40, 50, and 60, and that's supplements and what actually works. Because let's get real. The supplement world is loud. It's expensive. And honestly, a lot of it's backwards. So today, we are cutting through all the noise. And I'm joined by Dr. Mike T. Nelson, one of the top experts when it comes to human performance, metabolic flexibility, and understanding how the human body actually works. Mike is a research fanatic who specializes in metabolic flexibility, heart rate variability, and human performance. He spent 20 years of his life learning how the human body works and has a PhD in exercise physiology, a mechanical engineering degree. He's an associate professor at Carrick Institute, university instructor at Rocky Mountain University. He's the creator of the FLEX diet certification and physiologic flexibility. cert and he's also published research in both physiology and engineering peer reviews. It's a lot of stuff that he's done but today we're going to tap into his brain and talk about the supplement decision tree for men over 40, what actually works for hormones, performance and longevity. Mike, thanks so much for joining us today. Dr Mike T Nelson (01:20.266) Yeah, thank you so much for having me here. Really appreciate it. Funk Roberts (01:23.452) Yeah. So let's, let's talk about, you know, what, what, and why do men over 40, 50, 60 getting back into shape? Why do they get things completely wrong when it comes to supplementation? Dr Mike T Nelson (01:35.052) Yeah, mean, supplements I think are useful. And I'll outline the framework of why I think they're useful. As you know, like everything it feels like in society is becoming a more quicker fix, you know, putting in stuff on social media. It's like, oh my God, a three minute video. What are you crazy? You need a 30 second dancing monkey, like doing whatever like thing on it. Right. And everybody feels like their attention spans get shorter. And, know, from being in this industry forever, like you're, you're never going to replace the basics. Right. So once you have the basics, like make sure your exercise is good, make sure your nutrition is good, get some sleep for crying out. loud, you know, those are the basics. And once you get those down with what I call violent consistency, because it is going to take a fair amount of effort to get those down. However, there are some supplements that can be helpful along the way. Again, by definition, it's a supplement. It's not designed to absolutely replace other things all of the time. The reason why I do think supplements are useful is one that's, I mean, you probably get more I get more question`,

    content: `What would be the biggest bang for their buck right because if you're a coach or you're someone listening to this? You want to start with the things that are actually Funk Roberts (02:51.518) me. Dr Mike T Nelson (03:15.316) move the needle. And so I went through and initially just ranked them all based on you know physiology. What does the research say? How much does this move the needle? But then I'm looking at my list and I'm like okay I've got like number one was protein and number two was sleep. And I'm thinking about how many conversations I've had with you know clients of all forms about sleep. I can make tons of arguments about how it's super beneficial but getting them to actually do it was I'd rather pound my head through a wall half the time, right? Because at the end of the day it comes down to, bro, so you're telling me like these two hours I watched Netflix at night I can't do that, I'm supposed to go to bed? Kind of, right? You can only optimize your sleep environment so much and if you're sleeping four and a half hours, unless you're a deck two mutant, like yeah, you just need more sleep. So I came up and it's okay, well I'm gonna take the physiologic response times the client's ability to change and then to give that the coaching leverage score. So sleep it turns out very high physiologic, nine, maybe 10 out of 10. Clients ability to change like a frigging two, maybe a one, right? So overall aggregate score pretty low compared to something like protein. Protein very high, does a lot of great things physiologically. Most people you tell them you can eat more of something and get stronger, get leaner. They're like, I eat more of a food and I can actually get leaner. yeah, I'm in, right? So that was a much easier sell. The pro of supplements is the physiologic response may not be as high as some of the basics, but in general, the client's ability to do it is the action's pretty easy. Hey, take these two pills, put this powder in, drink it. So it has a huge advantage in terms of the ability to get them to do it. And so if you can do that and stack maybe some smaller wins, but get them moving in the right direction, I do think that is the pro of supplements. Funk Roberts (05:15.016) Yeah, the thing and I agree with you for sure. Like what can you get them to take or do to get the biggest bang for what we want them to achieve, whether it's sleep or getting more protein in. But the thing with, I know that was working with a lot of men, they'll go to the supplement store, right? So the first thing is, okay, they got the... Dr Mike T Nelson (05:35.694) yeah. Funk Roberts (05:37.844) You know, like even they get a plan, right? You get a plan, I my workouts, I got my nutrition, I'm ready to go now, what supplements do I need? And they'll walk i`,

    content: `Funk Roberts (00:01.273) Welcome everyone to today's Men Over 40 Health Summit Talk. I'm excited today to talk with Dr. Tom Cowan, who's one of the world's most thought-provoking voices in natural health. He's known for challenging conventional medical thinking, and he's a well-known alternative medical doctor, author, and speaker with a common sense holistic approach to health and wellness. He's given countless lectures and workshops throughout the US. on a of subjects in health and medicine, and is also an author of eight books. He currently lives with his wife, Linda, on a rural farm in upstate New York, has three children and one stepson. And as a medical doctor, an author, and a speaker, he brings powerful insights on health, on energy, and on the body's natural healing systems that every man over 40 needs to hear. And today, works. I'm excited, because we're going to talk about Tom's perspective in the scam of conventional medicine. So Tom, welcome, welcome, welcome. Tom Cowan (00:58.446) Thanks Funk, it's good to meet you again and talk to you again, second time. Funk Roberts (01:02.619) Yeah, for sure, for sure. So let's start off with, you know, what's one belief in the health industry that you think most men over 40 and 50 and 60 think that's true, you know, but it's actually keeping them sick or keeping them tired or aging them faster. Tom Cowan (01:20.178) That's a good question. I would say the belief that we're made out of a random collection of atoms which form themselves into molecules and everything that happens in us is based on so-called biochemistry. There's no order, there's no creation, there's no meaning to it all. It's all just random get over it. Funk Roberts (01:44.379) Right. So what does that mean to me? Because even for me, you say now, kind of like, okay, well, I've never really heard it kind of presented like that to me before. how would that, what you just explained to me, if you could explain a little bit more on how like a common, a regular guy would kind of get that information. Tom Cowan (02:06.126) So we all grow up, we don't even really realize this, but indoctrinated with the belief that living things are essentially no different than inorganic or nonliving things. We're just all made of molecules and the reason that these molecules, which we don't even know whether they've been actually shown to exist or not, called atoms, and they bounce together randomly and then create chemicals and these chemicals essentially control our lives. what I do is to, go, so the other answer I would have given is we live in a profoundly scientifically illiterate culture and I would have included myself in that until fairly recently, even though I got better over the years. And I would also include most men over 40, and most doctor`,

    content: `Tom Cowan (03:23.094) So the first thing I learned, which really changed my life, is that the process of science, and I would even say rational logical thinking, is science is a process of there's a claim made, and you investigate the claim, and you do not need to have a counter theory. So let me give you an example so everybody knows what I mean. Let's say you're 18 year old Asian fellow, your parents are Caucasian, you go rummaging in your parents closet, you find adoption papers, they got you from an orphanage in China. And so you never saw a picture and it's very clear you were adopted. So you go to your best friend, you say, I'm a little shook up because I just found out I was adopted. And he says to you, so who are your real parents? And you say, I don't know, I found me from an orphanage in China. And he says, until you tell me who your real parents are, I don't believe you were adopted. That's crazy, right? All right, so if I say, because this has to do with men over 40 and a big part of your thing, there is no evidence that a chemical called testosterone has ever been found in a living man. Funk Roberts (04:25.411) Absolutely. Tom Cowan (04:42.146) There's no evidence that blocked arteries cause heart attacks. There's no evidence that a particle called a virus actually exists or could cause COVID or chickenpox or measles. Now, interestingly, when I say that to most people, including doctors, they say, so what causes chickenpox? In other words, who are your real parents? And if you can't tell me who your real parents are, I don't believe I don't believe you. Or, so what causes heart attacks? Instead of investigating the claim that blocked arteries are the sole cause of heart attacks, that's how a scientifically literate person would do it. Or testosterone. They say, what makes you fit or healthy or strong after 40? Not Tell me how they found and claimed that testosterone is there in a living thing, in a living man. So let me talk about that one for a minute because I think it's relevant to your subject here. If that's okay. Funk Roberts (05:54.587) Yeah, yeah, I was going to go back to like, what do the parents have to do with blocked arteries to sauce on and viruses? Because you mentioned something about the parents, like not they're looking at science and not the parents. But what would the parents have to do? Okay. Okay. Okay. Tom Cowan (06:09.366) It's not the parents, it's the process of thinking. In other words, you don't investigate the claim is blocked arteries cause heart attacks. Whether I or anybody else knows what causes heart attacks has no more relevance to that claim than the fact that if you say you're adopted, you need to show me who your parents are before I know you were adopted. Both of those are. Funk Roberts (06:19.995) `,

    content: `Nick (00:00.192) Welcome everyone. Marcello is my name. I am the niche fragrance collector, and today I want to be sharing more about beautiful smells and activating our nose. Sometimes we put a lot of emphasis on sight as a sense or our hearing, but in fact, if we couldn't smell, our lives would be black and white. I know mine would be. Whereas when you activate your nose, all of a sudden your life becomes in technicolor. You begin to appreciate the things around you. As humans, we are super judgmental. In a nanosecond, we make judgments of others. Perfume is the mystery of you. Someone could look at you from a distance and go, hmm, I don't like, I do like, or I don't like the shirt, and I don't like that he has no hair. But then when they come close to you, they're like, whoa, is that you? I'm smelling something divine and something unique and beautiful. Is that you? And that has happened to me multiple times. In today's masterclass, I'm gonna break it up into three categories. One is perfume designation and understanding what some of these words mean. Siage, what does that even mean? Eau de parfum, eau de cologne. So let's break that down. Then I'm gonna talk about a fragrance wardrobe. Just like you have a wardrobe for your life, you wear something for work, but you wouldn't be wearing the same thing to a wedding, for instance, or to go out to the park. So same with a fragrance. You want to have something specific for a specific occasion. And then the last one, which I get a lot of questions on, is where to spray, how to make your fragrance last long. How do you make the fragrance so it can project really nicely and how can you smell it for a longer period of time? But before I start, who am I and why am I qualified to talk about these things? Well, the truth is I'm not really qualified, other than I am a deep perfume lover. Since the age of five, I was stealing my father's old spice, true story, and Just I just enjoyed beautiful smells. I have a very active nose, I smell things quite easily, and perfume has always been a part of my life. Then in 2021, I started a YouTube channel which is the Niche Fragrance Collector, and it's gained a lot of great momentum. I see perfume as an art form, and it's an art form that you can actually wear. Unlike wearing, I guess, a t-shirt of the Mona Lisa, I look like a tourist, whereas I could have a fragrance which is created by a master perfumer that Nick (02:19.576) Transports me to another location. It's also identifying core notes and key ingredients that are derived from nature and how are they used. About four years ago, this led me to create a touring company, KEM Fragrance Tours. We take people behind the scenes, we show them how perfumers work, we sh take them to the field to pick certain ingredients an`,

    content: `The perfumer is Luca Maffei. He's one of the most awarded perfumers within Italy. And he created three unique fragrances celebrating Milan, Florence, and Rome. If you want deeper access to all this information, you can go across to my YouTube channel. I go into a lot more detail about different fragrances, different houses from around the world, or across to my other socials. Today I'm going to give you top line information and you can also receive a free brochure, an overview of this masterclass that I'm about to share. Let's begin our journey with perfume designation. It's important to understand what all these different terminologies mean because they all serve a different purpose. What is an eau de cologne versus an eau de parfum? Why am I spending more money on one thing? How come it's not lasting on me? The core of it is the amount of oil that's in the actual fragrance, which then gives it its category essentially. We'll begin with the first one. This is an eau de cologne. An eau de cologne traditionally has between three to five percent oil in here. The rest of it is alcohol. So the idea behind it is that you have this incredible burst of effervescent sunshine essentially. It's very bright, it's a lot, it has a big push. The more alcohol in the actual fragrance, the bigger the volume is on that opening. But because the oil content is so low. You're gonna find that it doesn't last very long. On skin, you're probably getting about maybe four to five hours. I tend to find a lot of eau de colognes are citrus-based. This one here is the classic for that. This was created in believe it or not, in 1612 by the monks from the Santa Maria Novella Church. It was created for Caterina de' Medici. She was leaving Florence to become the Queen of France, and she wanted to remember her Italy. She said to the monks, make me a perfume that is citrus-based, that reminds me of. Nick (04:41.966) This beautiful landscape because I never want to forget my beautiful Italy, and this was created. It's called Acqua della Regina. You can still buy it today from Santa Maria Novella, and you'll find that it is a beautiful burst of sunshine, citruses and florals, and this wonderful herbal nature. It dries down to this woody aspect. It is, anybody can use it, a man or a woman, but I find that it is not as long-lasting. Four to five hours, it then gets a dry back. And then you have to reapply it again. And that again is because it's an eau de cologne. The next one, and you hear this quite often, is an eau de toilette. You tend to find that most eau de toilettes are between 10 to 15 percent when it comes to their oil concentration. The advantage that you have now is that this is a great fragrance that you can now take to the office. It'll last you at least five to six hours. It`,

And so for me, using breathing and breath work kind of started when I was younger as an athlete, right? Like, I was a professional athlete. And one of the things I remember hearing, do you remember if you recall back in the day, specifically if you're a runner or back when we used to do track and field in grade school or high school or what have gym class, whenever you got tired, your teacher or your coach back then would tell you, don't bend over. stand up straight and put your hands over your head. That's gonna bring in more oxygen. And I remember, I'v`,

    content: `5 Myths About Meditation In this presentation, I want to tell you about 5 myths about meditation. Debunking these myths will allow you and others to enjoy the benefits of meditation without fear or stigma. 1. Meditation Takes Up Too Much Time One of the most common myths about meditation is that it takes up too much time, or that you don't have enough time to meditate. In fact, this myth keeps many people from meditating because they assume they cannot fit meditating into their schedule. The truth of the matter is that meditation does take time, but everyone can do it. Just like any other task or action, meditation will require you to have a little time cut out for it. At the same time, though, meditation can fit into anyone's schedule. You just have to prioritize it. 2. Meditation is Religious A second common myth about meditation is that it is a religious or spiritual practice. This myth is partially true, but it does not have to be true for your practice. Your meditation is what you make it, and it is most important to make your meditation as comfortable for you as possible. Many religions incorporate meditation into their religious ritual. For example, some religions practice meditative yoga while others pray. Both of these rituals are a form of meditations. If you are religious, feel free to incorporate your religious beliefs into your meditation. If you are not religious, thats fine too. Meditation can simply be used as a way to look beyond the clutter of your life to find stillness and peace within yourself. Many scientific studies support the benefits of all meditation, meaning that you dont have to connect yourself to a higher power for the meditation to be effective and personal. So, meditation can be religious or nonreligious. It depends on how you want to practice it. 3. Meditation is for the Disciplined Another myth about meditation is that it is only for people with strong self-discipline. Like the previous myth, this third myth is also partially true in that meditation is a form of self-discipline. It is a way you control your mind in order to escape from the clutter and noise around you. In this regard, meditation Is for the disciplined because you must have a little bit of discipline in order to meditate. At the same time, though, you do not have to be extremely self-disciplined to meditate. You just have to be able to try to focus. You dont even have to be good at it! In fact, meditation is meant to help you get better. 4. Meditation is Boring The fourth myth about meditation is that it is boring. Many people think that meditation must involve sitting in silence while thinking and doing nothing. Though meditation can look like this, it does not have to. In fact, meditations can be very fun, engaging, and transformative. Some medi`,

    content: `4 Ways You Can Master Meditation Today, I want to tell you about four ways you can master meditation. But before I get into that, I want to take this opportunity to say that meditation is a process, not a destination. The more you meditate, the easier it will get. But, there are always ways in which you can improve your meditation and grow as an individual and meditator. Now, let us look at 4 ways you can master meditation. 1. Focus on Your Breathing The first way that you can master meditation is to focus on your breathing. Breathing is something that we do all the time, most of the time without even realizing it. During your meditation, you should use your breath as a way to intentionally anchor your meditation. In other words, utilize your physiological processes to make the most out of your meditation. Focusing on your breathing will help you master meditation for many reasons. Firstly, breathing is beneficial for your body. It decreases stress, relieves pain, stimulates the lymphatic system, improves immunity, lowers blood pressure, and more. Secondly, focusing on your breathing forces you to live in the moment. Since breathing happens in the present, it focuses your mind on a present action, as opposed to a past or future action or idea. Thirdly, focusing on your breathing will allow you to connect your mind and body as one. In the modern world, our bodies and mind are often treated as two separate entities, which results in a lot of stress in confusion about oneself. If you focus your mind on your breath, though, your mind is connected with your body through the process of the breath. 2. Switch Up Your Meditation The second way that you can master meditation is to switch up your meditation practice. Many people make the mistake of choosing one practice in sticking to it exclusively. This may be great if you're new to meditating and are still learning how to best meditate, but only doing one meditation does not allow you to grow or challenge yourself. As you become more advanced at meditation, you should try different meditation techniques in order to improve your meditative abilities. Whether you try guided meditations, self meditations, or group meditations, always try to push yourself so that way your skills grow. 3. Be Kind to Yourself A third way to master meditation is to be kind to yourself. Many people view meditation as a harsh form of self-discipline. While meditation is a form of discipline, this discipline should be mixed with kindness and compassion. By being kind to yourself, you put yourself in a more vulnerable position. It allows you to better feel your feelings in that moment and explore different parts of yourself. There's no way that you can master meditation without first learning how to speak to yourself in a kind and comp`,

I'm not going to bring out the supplements in this episode. I really just want to talk about the best vitamins that all of us should be taking. All of us should have in our pantry or in our supplement drawer.

So Sydney earlier on Perth, I work with the UFC. So I would do Australia, New Zealand events. My wife and I both do that. So my voice is going to be a little bit hoarse. I'm literally just coming back from this flight. Now let me talk about the flight for a second. I, like I mentioned before, we do this twice a year. I think we've even done it three times a year, plus the Thailand trip, plus we're going to China as well. And generally that, that flight. So let me talk about what the flight time is for those of you who don't know if, so I live in Toronto, right? So we're leaving Perth.

    content: `Top Reasons You Should Definitely Start Meditating Are you on the fence about meditation? Then lets make things a little simpler for you: this is something that you absolutely should do. Meditation is an incredibly useful skill and a form of brain training that can help to fortify your mind and make you more effective in a wide range of situations. In this post, well take a look at some of the most important reasons you should consider taking up meditation no matter who you are. It Thickens Your Brain Believe it or not, meditation can physically change the shape of your brain, making it thicker, stronger and better connected. Studies show that meditation increases the amount of white matter (cells that support the neurons) as well as cortical thickness in the all-important frontal regions. This correlates with improved attention, better memory and faster processing speeds. In short: meditation makes you smarter! It Helps You Deal With Stress Meditation is a tool that you can use whenever you need to escape from the rigors of daily life. This is a place you can escape to at any time, that allows you to rise above the various stressors and challenges that you normally face. At the same time though, meditation also helps you to remain on a more even keel all the time and to keep your mind still and placid. This is not only an important change for your own wellbeing, but also something that can have profound effect on your ability to perform under pressure. It Gives You Greater Emotional Control If you want to come across as someone who is calm, collected and on top of things, then keeping your emotions more even is one of the best ways to do that. We are instantly drawn to and impressed by people who seem to have their emotions under control and this is something that can help you to perform better in relationships, in your career and more. If you seem to be constantly in a fluster on the other hand, then youll seem volatile, unpredictable and potentially unreliable. It Provides Mental Discipline Meditation is the ultimate expression of self-discipline. This is the ability to sit quietly and not allow any distracting thoughts to derail your attempt to be calm and still. If you can manage to resist the temptation to think about other things, then in daily life youll be able to resist other impulses and other things that are trying to distract you too.`,

She works with entrepreneurs, executives, and high-achieving men to optimize health, hormones, body composition, and performance. Her core message: most men who do well in business spend their life building their business, taking care of everybody else, and then neglecting themselves. The symptoms of low testosterone — fatigue, brain fog, low motivation, that 2pm slump — are often dismissed. Men in shape earn 15% more than out-of-shape peers, and only 8% of men over 40 have visible abs. Your body is your business card. How you look when you walk in a room communicates discipline, work ethic, and standards before you say a word.",
    quote: "A lot of guys just sit and quietly take this in, and they just feel like it's this never-ending vicious cycle of I can't invest in myself.

Lab reference ranges have been reduced over time because men are showing up lower and lower — LabCorp reduced theirs in 2017. Most men naturally feel good at 600+ ng/dL, yet men in the 300s or even 250s-260s are told they're normal. Testosterone levels have declined 1% per year over the last 40 years. Low testosterone is no longer just an older man's problem — it's affecting men of all ages. The question is not 'are you normal?' but 'are you optimal?' A physician telling you your test is normal while you feel like garbage is not a green light — it's a missed diagnosis.",

Nasal sprays, pellets, and patches are suboptimal. The 'TRT starter pack' at fly-by-night clinics typically includes 200mg testosterone weekly, anastrozole (estrogen blocker), HCG, and Clomid or enclomiphene. This one-size-fits-all approach is the problem. Men do not need estrogen blockers — men need estrogen. Part of the benefit of testosterone replacement is conversion to estrogen, which is cardioprotective and neuroprotective. Blocking it creates new problems while solving nothing.",

Comprehensive blood work must go beyond total testosterone to include DHEA, pregnenolone, thyroid hormones (T3, T4, TSH), SHBG, prolactin, insulin, and HbA1c. These markers often matter as much or more than testosterone itself. Thyroid dysfunction, insulin resistance, inflammation, poor nutrition, stress, iron deficiencies, low DHEA, and metabolic dysfunction can all produce symptoms that look exactly like low testosterone. Ali's case studies with CEOs and executives consistently reveal hidden dysfunction — the 'normal labs' man who actually has low DHEA, subclinical thyroid issues, or iron-deficiency anemia limiting his response to any hormone therapy.",

Her body fat decision framework: if you're over 15% body fat, the priority is leaning out before considering hormone therapy — fat loss itself will improve testosterone, insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation. Under 15% body fat, the approach shifts toward muscle building and optimization. Aerobic training improves metabolic health and hormonal environment. Resistance training builds the muscle mass that supports testosterone. Nutrition must be personalized — low-carb approaches work for insulin-resistant men, while higher carb approaches may suit leaner, insulin-sensitive men.",

TRT does not cause prostate cancer — the relationship between testosterone and prostate cancer has been dramatically misrepresented. TRT is not only for older men — declining testosterone affects men in their 30s and 40s today. More testosterone is not always better — there is an optimal range, not a maximum target. Her mission: help men stop guessing about their health, understand what their blood work is really telling them, and build the strongest, healthiest version of themselves possible.

In adulthood, all three vanish. Career, marriage, and parenting dominate. You're no longer physically around people. Your peers are at different life stages. And unpressured time essentially ceases to exist. This is why adult friendship requires intentionality. Friendship in childhood was automatic. Friendship in adulthood must be designed.",

Social circles peak in high school and college, then experience a steep and noticeable decline as adult responsibilities kick in. If you don't understand this natural attrition, you'll drift into isolation believing everything else is fine. A common trap for men over 40 is over-reliance on their spouse for all emotional needs — companionship, stress relief, entertainment, personal growth, emotional support. One person cannot serve all of those roles. Putting too much pressure on a spouse damages the marriage. Men need diverse social ecosystems. The solution is understanding how friendships work and actively replenishing them.",

The Confidant — provides deep emotional conversations and safe emotional support. The Spark — brings fun, adventure, and spontaneity.

Most people think doing 10 isolated mobility drills will open up their hips. Instead, Alex teaches that carefully selecting the right variation of a split squat or goblet squat can restore motion while simultaneously building strength. Posture tells you what position someone is in. Joint position directly impacts range of motion. Rounded shoulders don't just look bad — they mechanically limit external rotation and overhead movement. The insight: you don't fix mobility by stretching more, you fix it by selecting exercises that train you through the ranges you're missing while building strength in those positions.",

Pillar 3 — Strength Through Range (develop strength throughout available ranges, not just at the midpoint; tempo training builds end-range stability).

Tempo training (3 seconds down, 3 seconds hold, 3 seconds up) builds end-range stability and movement control. Constraint-based training — heel elevation, box squats, front-foot elevated split squats — forces the body to access ranges it's been avoiding. Front-foot elevated split squats target hip mobility and reduce stiffness. Rear-foot elevated split squats build hip extension and internal rotation. Inverse training (performing conditioning first, skill work second) trains the body to maintain movement quality when tired. HICT (High Intensity Continuous Training) builds endurance without sacrificing movement patterns.",
